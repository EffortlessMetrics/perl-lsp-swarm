# Linux Packaging Scaffold

This directory holds the repo-owned packaging templates for Linux package
managers. The current package descriptions are for public-beta artifacts.

## Scope

- `apt/` holds Debian/Ubuntu packaging metadata templates
- `dnf/` holds RPM packaging metadata templates
- `pacman/` holds Arch-style packaging metadata templates
- `package-metadata.toml` carries shared release metadata for all three

## What this slice does

- Keeps the package-manager metadata in-repo and reviewable
- Makes the packaging shape explicit before any external repo publishing work
- Avoids depending on Launchpad, COPR, AUR, or other approval-gated infrastructure

## What this slice does not do

- It does not publish packages to third-party package repositories
- It does not claim official distro acceptance
- It does not replace the existing tarball-based GitHub release assets
- It does not imply a final-support channel; these templates describe the
  public-beta release line
- The current templates are x86_64-first so they stay small and reviewable; the metadata file also names the aarch64 GNU asset for the later matrix expansion

## Template inputs

The templates use placeholder tokens that can be rendered by a later release job:

- `__PACKAGE_NAME__`
- `__PACKAGE_SUMMARY__`
- `__PACKAGE_HOMEPAGE__`
- `__PACKAGE_LICENSE__`
- `__PACKAGE_MAINTAINER__`
- `__PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_LINE_1__`
- `__PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_LINE_2__`
- `__RELEASE_VERSION__`
- `__DEB_ARCH__`
- `__RPM_ARCH__`
- `__PACMAN_ARCH__`
- `__SOURCE_TARBALL__`
- `__SOURCE_DIR__`
- `__DOWNLOAD_URL__`
- `__DOWNLOAD_SHA256__`

The shared metadata file documents the package name, description, homepage, and the release asset names that should feed those templates.

## Rendering the templates

Use the repo-owned renderer to generate a concrete package tree for a specific
release:

```bash
python scripts/render-linux-packages.py \
  --version 0.12.0 \
  --download-base https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/releases/download/v0.12.0 \
  --download-sha256 <sha256-for-the-release-archive> \
  --arch x86_64 \
  --output-dir target/linux-packages
```

The renderer reads [`package-metadata.toml`](package-metadata.toml), selects the
correct release archive for the requested architecture, and writes:

- `target/linux-packages/apt/control`
- `target/linux-packages/dnf/perl-lsp.spec`
- `target/linux-packages/pacman/PKGBUILD`

Use `--arch aarch64` to render the arm64/aarch64 target set.
