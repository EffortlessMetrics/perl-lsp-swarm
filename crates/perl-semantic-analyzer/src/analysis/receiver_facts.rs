//! Receiver facts for trust-bounded method completion.
//!
//! This module classifies method-call receivers such as `$self->method`,
//! `Class->new`, `$hash{slot}->method`, and `$array[0]->method` without
//! changing completion behavior.  It converts existing rich [`TypeFact`] values
//! into a receiver-shaped fact that completion can later use for source-backed
//! ranking receipts.
