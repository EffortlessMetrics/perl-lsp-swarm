//! Layering invariant test: verify parser crate has no LSP provider dependencies.
//!
//! This test ensures that `perl-parser` remains a pure leaf crate without
//! LSP-shaped dependencies. The parser should only depend on core language
//! processing crates, not on application-layer LSP providers.
//!
//! The test is designed to FAIL before the refactor (#4414) and PASS after
//! removal of the 8 LSP provider re-exports and dependencies.
