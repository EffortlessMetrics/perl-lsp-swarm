//! Semantic query facade for workspace-level semantic lookups.
//!
//! Defines the [`SemanticQueries`] trait — the single entry point that all LSP
//! providers use for semantic lookups — and [`WorkspaceSemanticQueries`], the
//! concrete implementation that delegates to the underlying semantic indexes.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Providers call trait methods on `SemanticQueries` without knowing the
//! internal index structure. The workspace owns a `WorkspaceSemanticQueries`
//! instance that holds references to:
//!
//! - [`ReferenceIndex`] — typed reference lookups by name or entity.
//! - [`ImportExportIndex`] — import/export resolution for visibility.
//! - Per-file [`FileFactShard`] data for anchor/entity lookups.
//!
//! # Requirements
//!
//! - **Req 8.1**: `symbol_at` returns entity + occurrence at a file position.
//! - **Req 8.2**: `definitions` returns ranked `DefinitionCandidate` lists.
//! - **Req 8.3**: `references` returns typed `OccurrenceFact` lists.
//! - **Req 8.4**: `visible_symbols_at` returns `VisibleSymbol` lists.
//! - **Req 8.5**: `method_candidates` returns method candidates.
//! - **Req 8.6**: `rename_plan` returns a conservative rename plan.
//! - **Req 8.7**: `safe_delete_plan` returns a conservative safe-delete plan.
//! - **Req 5.4**: Definitions sorted by `DefinitionRank`.
//! - **Req 5.5**: Same-rank candidates sorted deterministically by URI + position.
//! - **Req 5.6**: Empty list (not error) when no candidates found.
