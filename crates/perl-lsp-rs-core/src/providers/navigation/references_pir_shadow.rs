//! PIR-A references shadow compare beside the legacy find-references provider.
//!
//! This module implements shadow comparison of the PIR-A lexical extractor path
//! against the legacy [`find_references_single_file`](super::find_references_single_file)
//! provider. It runs the PIR path **beside** the legacy path and records a
//! [`PirShadowCompareReceipt`] for scorecard aggregation.
//!
//! **Shadow-only — no cutover.** The live provider result is never changed by
//! this module. PR3 (#2635) performs the cutover. The legacy slice is passed in
//! and returned to the caller untouched; this module only *observes* it.
//!
//! # Guarded promotion machinery (PR3b, #2651)
//!
//! [`references_pir_promote`] is the corrected PR3a/b entry point. It is governed
//! by [`PromotionMode`], which ships as [`DEFAULT_PROMOTION_MODE`] (`Off`).
//! No live provider wiring occurs while the mode is `Off`; the `references.rs`
//! legacy arm is untouched.
//!
//! The live provider passes the mode from config. Flip criterion for
//! `PromotionMode::PromoteExact`: ops may set this only after a human sign-off
//! confirming that the PR2 shadow scorecard on issue #2635 shows
//! `extra_in_compiler == 0` across the full set1 fixture set for at least one
//! complete CI green run post-PR2 merge (the corpus-soak precondition from the
//! PR3 plan-reviewed spec). No individual agent may flip the mode without that
//! explicit human sign-off.
//!

/// Run the PIR-A lexical reference promotion with the corrected contract.
///
/// The `mode` parameter governs whether and how the compiler path is taken:
///
/// - [`Off`](PromotionMode::Off): return `LegacyFallback { reason: FeatureDisabled }` immediately.
/// - [`Shadow`](PromotionMode::Shadow): evaluate the candidate and return a
///   comparison receipt embedded in `LegacyFallback` (scorecard mode — live
///   result unchanged).
/// - [`PromoteExact`](PromotionMode::PromoteExact): return `Exact` when all
///   gates pass; refuse and return `LegacyFallback` otherwise.
///
/// # Promotion contract
///
/// The caller MUST NOT union the returned compiler ranges with the legacy
/// result. Choose one:
///
/// - [`Exact`](ReferencesPirPromoteOutcome::Exact) → return compiler ranges to
///   the LSP client; discard `legacy_result`.
/// - [`LegacyFallback`](ReferencesPirPromoteOutcome::LegacyFallback) → return
///   legacy result; discard compiler ranges.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `mode` — [`PromotionMode`] governing compiler-path activation.
/// * `target_sigil` — Variable sigil (`"$"`, `"@"`, `"%"`). **Sigil is part
///   of the identity:** `$x` and `@x` are distinct and must not collide.
/// * `target_name` — Bare variable name without sigil (e.g. `"x"` for `$x`).
///   Must not be `::` qualified; package variables are refused automatically.
/// * `pir_receipt` — The `LexicalExtractorReceipt` from `extract_lexical_facts`.
/// * `legacy_result` — The `(start_byte, end_byte)` pairs from
///   `find_references_single_file`; returned unmodified on fallback.
/// * `target_body_idx` — The body index in `pir_receipt.bodies` where the
///   target binding was found.
/// * `uri_mapper` — Converts a `(start_byte, end_byte)` pair to an LSP
///   `lsp_types::Range` (handles UTF-16 encoding for the LSP client).
/// * `opts` — [`ReferenceOptions`] controlling what is included (e.g.
///   `include_declaration`).
