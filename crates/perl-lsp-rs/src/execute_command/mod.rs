//! Execute command support for running tests and debugging.
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive executeCommand support for the Perl Language Server,
//! implementing a dual analyzer strategy that combines external tool integration with
//! built-in fallback analysis. The implementation ensures 100% availability and robust
//! security through workspace root enforcement and path traversal protection.
