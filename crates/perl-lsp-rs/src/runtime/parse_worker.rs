//! Off-lock async parse worker (#3396 Phase 3 -- Fresh Facts Fast lane).
//!
//! Moves full-parse + parent-map construction OUT of the `didChange`
//! mutation path. `didChange` (see `runtime/text_sync.rs`) applies the text
//! edit, bumps the document generation, enqueues a coalescing parse job on
//! this worker, and returns -- no parse, no parent-map build, before the
//! notification handler returns.
//!
//! ## Shape: bounded pool, per-URI latest-only
//!
//! This is deliberately **not** a single global serial worker (a slow parse
//! on one large file must not block every other open document) and
//! deliberately **not** a thread-per-open-file or task-per-keystroke design
//! (unbounded resource growth). Instead:
//!
//! - A fixed pool of [`PARSE_WORKERS`] dedicated `std::thread`s share one
//!   [`Coordinator`].
//! - At most one job is retained *pending* per URI -- a newer edit's job
//!   replaces (coalesces) an older, not-yet-started job for the same URI.
//! - Different URIs are dispatched to different pool threads and make
//!   progress independently and concurrently; only edits to the *same* URI
//!   are serialized against each other.
//!
//! `Coordinator::{enqueue, take_next, finish}` all lock the *same* single
//! `QueueState` mutex, so the "is this URI already owned by a worker" check
//! and the "did a newer job land while I was parsing" check are atomic with
//! respect to each other -- an earlier draft that split this bookkeeping
//! across two separately-locked maps had a TOCTOU window where a job could
//! be orphaned in the pending map with no worker watching it.
//!
//! Modeled on `diagnostic_debounce::DiagnosticDebouncer` for the
//! thread+callback installation pattern: a dedicated `std::thread` per
//! worker, not a tokio task, so the worker pool works identically whether
//! or not a tokio runtime exists on the calling thread -- many
//! unit/integration tests construct `LspServer` directly with no runtime at
//! all, and this worker must not require one.
//!
//! ## Coalescing + freshness-gated publish, not cancellation
//!
//! The worker does not cooperatively interrupt an in-flight parse when a
//! newer edit arrives (unlike the synchronous fallback path's
//! `Parser::new_with_cancellation`). Correctness instead comes from two
//! independent, always-on gates:
//!
//! 1. **Coalescing before start**: at most one pending job per URI. A newer
//!    edit's job silently replaces an older, not-yet-started job for the
//!    same URI ([`ParseWorkerMetrics::jobs_coalesced`]).
//! 2. **Freshness-gated publish**: once a job's parse completes, publishing
//!    goes through
//!    [`crate::state::DocumentState::publish_parsed_if_current`] (#3579),
//!    which rejects a publish whose generation no longer matches the
//!    document's current generation
//!    ([`ParseWorkerMetrics::jobs_rejected_stale`]).
//!
//! Both gates only need to be "eventually correct" -- a wasted parse that
//! is later rejected at publish is a bounded CPU cost, never a correctness
//! hazard, because publication is always freshness-gated. `jobs_cancelled`
//! stays 0 today; wiring true mid-parse cancellation into this queue is a
//! deliberate follow-up, not required for correctness here.
//!
//! ## Publication transaction
//!
//! `process_job` parses into **private** locals, builds a **private**
//! `ParsedSnapshot`, then takes the `documents` lock exactly once to check
//! document-instance identity (see below) and attempt
//! `publish_parsed_if_current`. If rejected: return immediately, zero side
//! effects -- no diagnostics, no index update, no symbol reindex. If
//! accepted: the post-publish callback receives the data captured at parse
//! time directly (never a fresh lookup of "the document" after the fact,
//! which would reopen exactly the staleness window the publish gate just
//! closed).
//!
//! A parse failure (`ast: None`) still builds and attempts to publish a
//! `ParsedSnapshot` with `degradation_tier: Minimal` -- a current-generation
//! parse failure must supersede an older successful snapshot, not leave it
//! current forever.
//!
//! ## Document-instance identity (the close/reopen ABA hazard)
//!
//! A plain `u32` generation compare is not enough: `textDocument/didClose`
//! removes the `DocumentState` entirely (see
//! `LspServer::evict_open_document_session_state`), and a subsequent
//! `didOpen` for the *same URI* installs a brand-new `DocumentState` with a
//! fresh `Arc<AtomicU32>` generation counter starting back at 0. A parse job
//! queued against the old document could, in principle, be dequeued after
//! the close+reopen cycle and find a *numerically* matching generation on
//! the new document purely by coincidence. Each [`ParseJob`] therefore
//! carries the exact `Arc<AtomicU32>` handle it was enqueued against, and
//! the worker requires `Arc::ptr_eq` identity -- not just numeric equality
//! -- before it will even attempt `publish_parsed_if_current`. A job whose
//! document instance was closed (and possibly reopened) under it is
//! rejected regardless of what generation number the new instance happens
//! to be at.
