//! LSP server lifecycle management
//!
//! This module manages the LSP server initialization, shutdown, and workspace configuration.
//! It implements the LSP lifecycle protocol and coordinates workspace-wide resources.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The lifecycle layer is organized into focused submodules:
//!
//! - **capabilities**: Server capability declaration and client capability negotiation
//! - **module_resolution**: Perl module path resolution and `@INC` configuration
//! - **tools**: External tool integration (perltidy, perlcritic)
//! - **watchers**: File system watchers for workspace file changes
//! - **workspace**: Workspace folder management and root path resolution
//!
//! # Initialization Flow
//!
//! 1. `initialize` request received with client capabilities
//! 2. Server capabilities computed based on client support
//! 3. Workspace folders registered and watchers configured
//! 4. Module resolution paths established from workspace structure
//! 5. `initialized` notification confirms server readiness
//! 6. Index coordinator transitions to Building or Ready state
//!
//! # Workspace Index Integration
//!
//! The lifecycle module coordinates with the workspace index coordinator:
//!
//! - Transitions index to Ready state when workspace scanning completes
//! - Sends `perl-lsp/index-ready` notification to clients
//! - Manages index state for single-file vs. workspace modes
//!
//! # Client Capability Handling
//!
//! Server adapts behavior based on client capabilities:
//!
//! - **textDocument/completion**: Snippet support, commit characters
//! - **textDocument/publishDiagnostics**: Related information, tags
//! - **workspace/workspaceFolders**: Multi-root workspace support
//! - **window/workDoneProgress**: Progress reporting for long operations
//!
//! # Shutdown Protocol
//!
//! 1. `shutdown` request received - server prepares for termination
//! 2. Ongoing operations cancelled gracefully
//! 3. `exit` notification triggers actual process termination
//! 4. Exit code 0 if shutdown was received, 1 otherwise
