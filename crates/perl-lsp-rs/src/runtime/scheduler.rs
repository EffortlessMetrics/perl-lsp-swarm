//! Request classification, prioritization, and scheduling for concurrent dispatch.
//!
//! Classifies incoming LSP methods into scheduling categories that determine
//! how they are executed:
//!
//! - **Control**: Processed inline immediately (cancellation, progress cancel)
//! - **Lifecycle**: Exclusive access (initialize, shutdown, exit)
//! - **Mutation**: Exclusive access (didOpen, didChange, didClose, etc.)
//! - **ReadOnly**: Concurrent access (hover, completion, definition, etc.)
//!
//! # Request Prioritization
//!
//! Read-only requests are processed by priority rather than strict FIFO.
//! The priority ordering (highest to lowest) is:
//!
//! 1. `Hover` — cursor queries are latency-sensitive
//! 2. `Completion` — inline suggestions block the user
//! 3. `References` — navigation is slightly less urgent
//! 4. `Other` — background/bulk operations (workspace symbols, diagnostics, etc.)
//!
//! # Stale Request Cancellation
//!
//! Position-sensitive reads are cancelled before execution in two ways:
//!
//! 1. **Position dedupe**: if a newer request arrives for the same
//!    `(method, uri, line, character)` key, the older request is cancelled.
//!    Useful for the "same cursor position, repeated query" case.
//!
//! 2. **Generation freshness** (PR 4 of the 0.15.1 Neovim latency lane):
//!    at ingress every position-sensitive read captures the document's
//!    current generation. Before execution, the dispatcher compares that
//!    snapshot to the document's current generation; if the document has
//!    moved on (i.e. a `didChange` bumped the generation between ingress
//!    and dispatch), the read is cancelled. This is the case that pure
//!    position dedupe misses — normal typing moves the cursor and changes
//!    the position key on every keystroke, so the dedup map sees only
//!    unique entries.
//!
//! The [`Scheduler`] struct manages dedicated worker queues so the ingress loop
//! never performs heavy work — it only classifies and enqueues.
