//! Inline completions provider — delegated to perl-lsp-inline-completion (#2756).
//!
//! The upstream crate uses `utf16_line_col_to_offset` for correct UTF-16
//! character-position handling as required by the LSP protocol (§3.17).
//! The previous local implementation used raw byte offsets which gave
//! silently wrong results for documents containing non-BMP characters.
