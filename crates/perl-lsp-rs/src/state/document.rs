/// [`DocumentState::publish_parsed_if_current`]. Once published a snapshot
/// never changes -- a new parse produces a brand-new `ParsedSnapshot`, never
/// a mutation of an existing one.
///
/// This is the single source of truth for parsed state: `DocumentState` holds
/// at most one snapshot (`Option<Arc<ParsedSnapshot>>`) rather than the four
/// separate `ast` / `parse_errors` / `parent_map` / `degradation_tier` fields
/// it used to carry, so there is no dual-write and no way for those fields to
/// disagree with each other or with the generation they were parsed from.
///
/// ## Construction is guarded, not free
///
/// Every field is private. The only way to build a `ParsedSnapshot` is
/// [`Self::from_parse_result`], which derives `content_hash` from the exact
/// source text passed in, builds `parent_map` from the exact `ast` passed in
/// (never a different AST), and derives `degradation_tier` from the `(ast,
/// parse_errors)` pair -- so a caller cannot assemble a snapshot with a
/// parent map from one parse paired with an AST from another, a
/// `content_hash` that doesn't describe the parsed source, or a
/// degradation tier that disagrees with `ast`/`parse_errors`. Read fields
/// through the accessor methods below.
///
/// ## Generation-owned lazy analysis (#3760)
///
/// A snapshot also owns its `source` text and lazily materializes exactly two
/// generation-bound analysis objects behind `OnceLock`s: a single-file
/// [`crate::semantic::SemanticAnalyzer`] and a single-file
/// [`crate::type_inference::TypeInferenceEngine`]. Both are derived from *this*
/// snapshot's own `ast` and `source` — never a later generation's — so any
/// caller that reads analysis through [`Self::semantic_analyzer`] /
/// [`Self::type_environment`] gets facts for the exact text this snapshot was
/// parsed from, with no cross-generation bleed. They are built at most once,
/// on first request, and shared thereafter ([`OnceLock::get_or_init`] makes
/// concurrent first-callers initialize exactly once); a superseded snapshot on
/// which they are never requested performs zero semantic construction, and
/// drops its analysis with its `Arc` when the generation advances.
///
/// **This is the generation-owned path only for callers that have been
/// migrated to use it.** As of #3760 that was completion's type-detail read;
/// as of #3766, hover reads both `semantic_analyzer()` and
/// `type_environment()` through these cells too, and the old `LspServer`-level
/// `(uri, content_hash)`-keyed caches (`semantic_analyzer_cache` /
/// `type_inference_engine_cache`, formerly in `runtime/document_access.rs`)
/// have been retired — hover was their only consumer. References and rename
/// still read analyzer/type-environment facts through a separate
/// empty-source `SemanticAnalyzer::analyze(ast)` path; migrating them is
/// tracked as follow-up slices (see #3766 context).
///
/// This is deliberately *not* the workspace-wide `SemanticSnapshot` /
/// `FileSemanticBundle` substrate (#1598/#1601): those own cross-file facts on
/// their own generation clock. These two cells are pure single-file analysis,
/// owned per document snapshot.
///
/// `Debug` is hand-written (rather than derived) because neither
/// `SemanticAnalyzer` nor `TypeInferenceEngine` implements `Debug`; the two
/// cells render only as a `built`/`lazy` status.
///
/// `Clone` still derives: cloning a `ParsedSnapshot` clones the `OnceLock`
/// cells' *current state* (unpopulated stays unpopulated; populated shares
/// the same `Arc` via `OnceLock`'s `Clone` impl, not a deep copy). Nothing in
/// this codebase clones a bare `&ParsedSnapshot` before its cells populate —
/// snapshots are always shared as `Arc<ParsedSnapshot>` — but a future direct
/// `.clone()` taken *before* first analysis request, followed by requests on
/// both the original and the clone, would double-build (each clone gets its
/// own independent `OnceLock`, not a shared one). Not a bug today; worth
/// knowing before adding a call site that clones the struct directly.
