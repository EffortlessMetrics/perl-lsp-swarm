//! PIR v0 data model.
//!
//! PIR ("Perl intermediate representation") is a source-anchored tooling IR
//! lowered from [`HirFile`](crate::hir::HirFile). It is oriented around editor
//! tooling and static analysis, not bytecode execution: it preserves source
//! anchors, dynamic-boundary links, and expression context so later analyses
//! (control flow, dead code, safe delete, rename safety) have an honest base.
//!
//! PIR v0 is a compiler-substrate data layer only. It never evaluates Perl,
//! never runs `perldoc`/DAP/application code, never replaces HIR as the
//! canonical syntax tree, and never changes LSP provider behavior. The
//! authoritative contract is [`PLSP-SPEC-0025`](../../../../docs/specs/PLSP-SPEC-0025-pir-v0.md).
