//! Shared HIR lowering-disposition registry.
//!
//! This is the **single source of truth** for how every AST [`NodeKind`] is
//! treated by the HIR lowerer (`lower.rs`) and by the `hir-coverage` metrics
//! tool (`xtask/src/tasks/metrics/hir_coverage.rs`).
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! [`LoweringDisposition`] is multi-axis: each flag is independent, allowing
//! kinds that both emit HIR items *and* record side-facts (e.g. `Package`)
//! to be described accurately.  A legacy four-category view
//! ([`LegacyCategory`]) is derived from the flags for backward-compatible
//! reporting.
//!
//! ## Keeping this file in sync
//!
//! When you add a new `NodeKind` variant:
//!
//! 1. Add an entry to [`disposition_for`] that describes its lowering behavior.
//! 2. The xtask `hir-coverage --check` CI gate will fail if the entry is
//!    missing — this is intentional: the check guards against silent fallthrough
//!    in `lower.rs`.
//!
