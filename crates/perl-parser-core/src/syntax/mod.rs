//! Syntax-level types and utilities absorbed from Wave D satellite crates.
//!
//! This module contains the internal implementations of AST-adjacent utilities
//! that were previously published as separate satellite crates. They are now
//! internal modules of `perl-parser-core`.
//!
//! # Visibility pattern
//!
//! - `error` is an internal submodule exposed via `engine::error` (and
//!   root-level re-exports like `ParseError`, `ParseOutput`, `error_classifier`).
//! - `edit` and `heredoc` are re-exported at crate root under their own names
//!   (`syntax::edit`, `heredoc_collector`).
//! - `path_normalize`, `path_security`, `percentile`, `qualified_name`,
//!   `source_file`, and `text_line` are re-exported directly at crate root
//!   so consumers use `perl_parser_core::path_normalize` etc.
//! - `quote` and `quote_geometry` are accessed via `engine::quote_parser` to
//!   keep quote-parsing concerns encapsulated behind the engine boundary.
