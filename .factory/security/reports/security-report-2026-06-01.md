## Scan Details

### Commits Scanned

- `648ce43` - feat(inline): complete aggregate assignment RHS (#8197) (#1082)

### Changed Files Analysis

The weekly scan examined changes from 1 commit containing configuration, schema, and fixture files. No Rust source code implementing security-sensitive functionality was changed.

### Security Controls Verified

The following security controls remain active and properly implemented:

| Control | Status | Location |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Path Validation | Active | perl-parser-core/src/syntax/path_security.rs |
| Transport Framing | Active | perl-lsp-rs-core/src/transport/framing.rs |
| DAP Security | Active | perl-dap/src/security/mod.rs |
| Subprocess Sandboxing | Active | perl-lsp-rs/src/security/sandbox.rs |
| Frame Size Limits | Active | MAX_FRAME_SIZE = 16MB |
| File Content Limits | Active | 1MB max file content |

#### Key Security Features Reviewed

**Sandbox Implementation (sandbox.rs):**
- Fail-closed when firejail is unavailable on Linux
- Fail-closed when Windows job objects are not implemented
- Perl taint mode (-T) enabled for all script execution
- Path escaping for macOS sandbox profile DSL

**DAP Security (security/mod.rs):**
- Path traversal prevention with canonicalization
- Expression validation blocks newlines/carriage returns
- Timeout validation (max 300s, default 5s)
- Workspace boundary enforcement

## Findings by STRIDE Category

| Category | Threats | Severity Distribution |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| Spoofing | 3 | Medium (1), High (2) |
| Tampering | 4 | Critical (1), High (3) |
| Repudiation | 2 | Low (1), Medium (1) |

| Denial of Service | 5 | Critical (2), High (2), Medium (1) |
| Elevation of Privilege | 6 | Critical (2), High (3), Medium (1) |

## Recommendations

### Priority P0 (Immediate)

No critical exploitable vulnerabilities were found in this week's changes. The existing security controls are functioning as designed.

### General Security Best Practices

1. **Continue using taint mode (-T)** for all Perl subprocess execution
2. **Maintain path canonicalization** with symlink detection
3. **Enforce command allowlisting** via `get_supported_commands()`
4. **Monitor for anomaly detection** on large file submissions
