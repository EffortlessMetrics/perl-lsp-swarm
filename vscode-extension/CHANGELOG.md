# Change Log

All notable changes to the Perl Language Server extension will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Moved the extension toolchain authority to Node 26.x and npm 11.18.0; CI
  pins Node 26.5.0.** The shipped-extension compatibility boundary remains
  `engines.vscode`. (#4121)
- **Migrated the extension toolchain to TypeScript 7, type-aware Oxlint,
  Oxfmt, and Rolldown.** TypeScript remains the type-check authority;
  Rolldown now produces the CommonJS extension bundle. (#3645, #3690,
  #3721, #3736, #3755)
- **Reduced the packaged VSIX from 458 files / 1.25 MB to 33 files / 291
  KB** while preserving extension activation, command registration, native
  LSP and DAP startup, binary auto-download and extraction, source maps,
  integration tests, and published-extension smoke coverage. (#3755)
- **Removed the legacy `ts-jest`, ESLint, and `@typescript-eslint`
  compiler-API dependencies.** No TypeScript or JavaScript toolchain
  binaries are shipped inside the extension. (#3645, #3690)
- **Made extension development and packaging reproducible:** npm/Node
  authority, all TypeScript authority configurations, non-growing strictness
  and lint baselines, exact-source VSIX/current-server smoke, repeated startup
  receipts, and VSIX inventory/size checks now have explicit gates and current
  documentation.

### Added

- **First-run include-path discovery**: on activation the extension scans
  common Perl module directories (`src`, `local`, `vendor`, `lib`, `t/lib`,
  `blib/lib`, `modules`) and offers a one-time suggestion to add any directory
  that holds `.pm` files but isn't in `perl-lsp.includePaths` — so projects
  without a `lib/` layout no longer fail silently. The suggestion is cached per
  unique project structure and never re-prompts after dismissal. (#1633)
- **AI completion discoverability**: a new "AI-Powered Completions (Optional)"
  walkthrough step plus a capability-gated one-time prompt. When the running
  server advertises `inlineCompletionProvider` and the feature is off, the
  extension offers to enable `perl-lsp.aiCompletion.enabled`. The setting
  description now states it is off by default and server-gated. (#1634)
- **Demo project**: a new `Perl: Open Demo Project` command opens a bundled
  demo project (`lib/Utils.pm`, `lib/Database.pm`) so first-time users can try
  completion, hover, and go-to-definition without their own project ready. The
  Get Started walkthrough's "Open a Perl Project" step now links to it. (#1635)

### Fixed

- **Extension activation no longer blocks on language-server startup.** UI and
  commands now register and activation returns immediately while the language
  client's startup tail completes in the background, instead of blocking
  activation (and every command that depends on it) behind a slow server
  start on large workspaces. (#3162)

## [0.12.4] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- **DAP debugger launch scorecard**: the debug adapter now tracks cold-launch
  success rate and P50/P95 latency across a suite of fixture programs; results
  surface in the new `status/dap.md` page. (#4237)
- **Inherited and role method navigation**: `Go to Definition`, hover, and
  workspace completion now traverse Moo/Moose `with 'Role'` and
  `extends`/`use parent` chains. AUTOLOAD-backed method calls also resolve.
  (#4077, #4091)
- **Phase-scoped pragma diagnostics** (`PL502`, `PL503`): flags `use strict` /
  `use warnings` placed inside phase blocks (`BEGIN`, `END`, etc.) where they
  have block scope rather than file scope, with quick-fixes that move them to
  file scope. (#4131)
- **`workspace/configuration` live reload**: server re-fetches per-folder
  configuration from the client on `workspace/didChangeConfiguration`, merging
  returned overlays over `.perl-lsp.toml` without a restart. (#4093)
- **`workspace/willDeleteFiles` warnings**: deleting a file that is referenced
  by other files in the workspace now surfaces a `Warning` diagnostic before
  the delete completes. (#4056)
- **Run Test at Cursor**: new command palette entry runs the nearest test
  subroutine or subtest under the cursor without navigating to a test lens.
  (#4025)
- **`yath` test runner preference**: the VS Code test runner uses `yath` when
  present on PATH, falling back to `prove` and `perl`. (#4031)

### Fixed

- **Rename operations are faster on large files**: the internal scope traversal
  was O(n×d) per rename; replaced with a single-pass BFS so renames on deeply
  nested files no longer stall. (#4240)
- **Windows: Run Tests / Run File no longer fail** with extended-length path
  errors — the `\\?\` prefix injected by `Path::canonicalize` is stripped
  before spawning `perl`, `prove`, or `yath`. (#4089)
- **`use if` / `use unless` conditional pragmas** no longer produce false
  missing-strict/warnings diagnostics. (#4050)
- **Eval- and sub-scoped pragmas** no longer suppress file-level PL100/PL101
  missing strict/warnings diagnostics. (#4052)
- **Non-`file://` workspace roots** (`vscode-remote://`, virtual schemes) are
  now tolerated — the server keeps them as LSP strings and skips non-filesystem
  folders during indexing without crashing. (#4059)

### Changed

- **Pre-push hook speed**: the hook now runs the fast Tier A (`pr-fast`) check
  instead of the full `ci-gate`, making pre-push validation ~3× faster for
  routine pushes. (#4088, #4110)

## [0.12.3] - 2026-04-09

The 0.12.3 release line. Aligned with the workspace `v0.12.3` cut and consolidates
the user-facing UX hardening work from April 2026.

### Fixed

- **Actionable error messages**: server startup errors now surface specific,
  actionable messages instead of a generic "corrupted" fallback
  (PR #3308, PR #3291).
- **Perl interpreter detection**: distinct error shown when the Perl interpreter
  is not found in PATH, with a clear install prompt (PR #3312).
- **Binary download errors**: download failures include the underlying OS error
  and a retry hint instead of a silent failure (PR #3306).
- **Settings schema polish**: extension settings entries cleaned up for the
  VS Code Settings UI — descriptions, defaults, and enum labels improved
  (PR #3269).
- **Enterprise/offline deployment**: documentation added for air-gapped binary
  distribution and internal mirror configuration (PR #3310).

## [0.12.2] - 2026-04-04

The 0.12.2 release line. Aligned with the workspace `v0.12.2` cut on 2026-04-04
and consolidates the v0.12.2 through v0.12.8 milestones into a single release.

### Added

- **AI inline completion**: opt-in OpenAI-compatible streaming provider with
  session management, version-aware cancellation, and a deterministic fallback
  when AI is disabled. Wired into the LSP server's `inlineCompletion` request
  via the new `experimental.perlInlineCompletionStream` extension.
- **Heredoc language injection**: SQL keyword and JSON key detection in
  heredocs with multi-heredoc-per-line support.
- **Type inference in hover**: type hints rendered alongside symbol info.
- **Dead code highlighting**: `DiagnosticTag::Unnecessary` for unreachable code.
- **Refactoring code actions**: extract variable, extract subroutine, inline
  subroutine, scoped rename.
- **POD preview panel**: `Perl: Preview POD` command opens a side panel with
  formatted POD output.
- **AST explorer debug panel**: `perl/showAst` custom LSP handler for
  inspecting parser output during diagnostics.

### Performance

- Incremental parsing pipeline (token caching + checkpoint recovery).
- Large-workspace HashMap optimization (faster startup).
- CPAN-scale benchmarks: 10K files indexed in 672ms.

### Fixed

- Inline completion duplicate backend types removed.
- Streaming completion controller gating on AI config flags.

### Changed

- **Version Bump**: 0.12.2 release aligned with the workspace and shipped
  `perllsp` asset line.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- **Release Surface Recovery**: Restored the top-level source snapshot and release-facing docs after the launch regressions that slipped into the first `0.12.0` tag.
- **Hook Hygiene**: Hardened hook-test fixture isolation and worktree hook installation so placeholder identities do not leak into normal local commit flows.

### Changed

- **Version Bump**: 0.12.1 fix-forward release aligned with the workspace and shipped `perllsp` asset line.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-03-19

- **Preview Flag**: Marked as preview for public alpha period
- **Keywords**: Added `debugger`, `refactoring`, `code-completion`, `diagnostics` for marketplace discovery
- **Categories**: Added "Testing" to reflect Test Explorer integration

### Added

- **Open VSX Publishing**: Extension now publishes to Open VSX Registry alongside VS Marketplace, enabling first-class support for VSCodium and other open-source VS Code derivatives. Added `ovsx` publish/check scripts and `@types/vscode` dev dependency fix for compatible builds.
- **Comprehensive README**: Rewritten for marketplace listing with full configuration reference table, keyboard shortcuts, troubleshooting guide, and command reference

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- **Corrupted Extension Icon**: Added binary rules for image files in `.gitattributes` to prevent line-ending normalization from corrupting PNGs; regenerated `icon.png` with correct PNG signature header.
- **TextMate Grammar Registration**: Registered `syntaxes/perl.tmLanguage.json` in `contributes.grammars` so VS Code actually loads the bundled grammar.
- **Stub Refactoring Commands**: Removed `Extract Subroutine`, `Extract Variable`, and `Inline Variable` from editor context and command palette menus (still available from the full command list with "in development" messaging).
- **VSCE Packaging**: Removed `--no-dependencies` flag so runtime dependencies (`vscode-languageclient`, `adm-zip`, `tar`) are properly bundled in the `.vsix`.
- **pnpm Compatibility**: Made `vsce package`/`publish` resilient in pnpm environments.

### Changed

- **Parser Bug Fixes** (6 fixes in the underlying `perl-lsp` server):
  - Handle postfix modifiers after dereference expressions (`$obj->method if $cond`)
  - Re-lex slash as regex delimiter after `split` keyword
