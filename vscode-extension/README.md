A fast, native Perl 5 language server extension. Written in Rust for speed and reliability. No runtime dependencies -- just install and code.

> **Public Beta** -- This extension is under active development. Every feature listed below is wired up and exercised by tests, but as a beta you will find edge cases where behavior is incomplete or wrong. Please [report issues](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/issues/new/choose) if you encounter problems. For what the project's headline numbers mean (and do not mean), see the [status overview](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/blob/master/docs/project/status/index.md).

`perl-lsp` uses proof-backed answers where it has fresh, source-backed facts and
keeps fallback or no-edit behavior where Perl is dynamic, generated, stale,
ambiguous, or low confidence. See the [editor trust guide](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/blob/master/docs/how-to/EDITOR_TRUST.md)
for support-tier boundaries, explanations, previews, and copyable receipts.

## Features

### Navigation and Intelligence

- **Go to Definition** -- Jump to source-backed definitions where proof is available, with fallback for ambiguous or dynamic cases
- **Find References** -- Find source-backed usages and keep fallback behavior for unsupported shapes
- **Hover Documentation** -- Show provenance-backed docs and module-lookup explanations where available
- **Auto-completion** -- Rank proof-backed variables, functions, and modules while preserving fallback for uncertain candidates
- **Signature Help** -- Real-time parameter hints as you type function calls
- **Symbol Navigation** -- Outline view, breadcrumbs, and workspace symbol search with generated/dynamic boundaries labeled or gated

### Refactoring and Code Actions

- **Rename** -- Scoped lexical and package-local renames only where source-backed proof and fallback guards pass
- **Preview Safe Delete** -- Preview allowed, blocked, or refused symbol deletion before any edit is returned
- **Preview Package Rename** -- Preview package/compiler-backed rename evidence without authorizing broad edits
- **Extract Variable** -- Pull out expressions into named variables
- **Extract Subroutine** -- Create functions from selected code blocks
- **Organize Imports** -- Sort and clean `use` statements (`Shift+Alt+O`)

### Diagnostics and Quality

- **Real-time Errors** -- Syntax and semantic error detection as you type
- **Undefined Variables** -- Catch typos under `use strict`
- **Unused Variables** -- Find dead code
- **Missing Pragmas** -- Suggest `strict` and `warnings`
- **Diagnostic Explanations** -- Explain PL701/PL109 evidence, fallback, and setup boundaries when receipts are available
- **Document Formatting** -- Native Perl formatting (`Shift+Alt+F`)

### Advanced Features

- **Semantic Highlighting** -- Context-aware syntax coloring beyond TextMate grammars
- **Type Hierarchy** -- Navigate inheritance with `@ISA` and `use parent`
- **Call Hierarchy** -- Trace function calls inbound and outbound
- **CodeLens** -- Inline reference counts above functions
- **Inlay Hints** -- Type annotations shown inline in the editor
- **Code Folding** -- Collapse subs, blocks, POD, and heredocs

### AI Completion

Perl LSP supports **AI-powered inline completions**, surfaced through VS Code's
inline-suggestion UI. The feature is **off by default** and only available when
your language server advertises inline-completion support (`inlineCompletionProvider`).

To enable it, set `perl-lsp.aiCompletion.enabled` to `true` (Settings → search
`perl-lsp.aiCompletion`). Progressive streaming is controlled separately by
`perl-lsp.aiCompletion.streaming.enabled`. When the running server advertises
support and the feature is off, the extension also offers a one-time prompt to
turn it on.

### Quick Start: Demo Project

New to the extension and don't have a Perl project handy? Run
**Perl: Open Demo Project** from the command palette (or use the "Open a Perl
Project" step in the Get Started walkthrough). It opens a small bundled project
with `lib/Utils.pm` and `lib/Database.pm` so you can immediately try completion,
hover, and go-to-definition.

### Debugging (via perl-dap)

- **Breakpoints** -- Set breakpoints with conditional support
- **Step Debugging** -- Step into, over, and out of function calls
- **Variable Inspection** -- View variables, watch expressions, and call stack
- **Attach to Process** -- Debug running Perl processes by PID or TCP

Debugging is optional and powered by the managed `perl-dap` adapter shipped
alongside the `perl-lsp` release artifacts -- the extension downloads it for you,
there is nothing extra to install. Native debug sessions require a local Perl
interpreter. The native path does **not** require `Perl::LanguageServer`; that
module is only needed for legacy bridge-mode workflows. See the
[debugging guide](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/blob/master/docs/tutorials/DAP_USER_GUIDE.md) for setup steps and
the required launch configuration.

### Test Explorer

- **Test Discovery** -- Automatic discovery of `.t` test files
- **Run Tests** -- Run individual tests or entire files from the Testing panel (`Shift+Alt+T`)
- **TAP Support** -- Native Test Anything Protocol result parsing

### Extension Coexistence

If VS Code warns that other Perl extensions are installed, keep one provider
for navigation, diagnostics, and formatting where possible. Perl Navigator,
Perl::Critic, and PerlTidy can overlap with perl-lsp features. If you see
duplicate hover, completion, or formatting results, disable the competing
feature in one extension and keep the other as the source of truth.

### Get Started walkthrough

The extension ships an eight-step **Get Started with Perl LSP** walkthrough.
Reopen it at any time from the command palette with **Welcome: Open
Walkthrough**, then pick it from the list.

## Installation

Install from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EffortlessMetrics.perl-lsp-rs) or [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-rs).

The extension can manage verified public-beta GitHub release binaries; registry
publication is independent, so check the displayed extension version.

```bash
# VS Code
code --install-extension EffortlessMetrics.perl-lsp-rs

# VSCodium / Open VSX
codium --install-extension EffortlessMetrics.perl-lsp-rs

# PearAI (VS Code-compatible)
# Install from Open VSX inside PearAI's Extensions view:
# EffortlessMetrics.perl-lsp-rs
```

The extension automatically downloads the correct `perllsp` binary for your platform on first activation:

| Platform    | Architectures                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Windows** | x64                                |
| **macOS**   | Intel (x64), Apple Silicon (ARM64) |
| **Linux**   | x64, ARM64 (glibc and musl)        |

There is no native ARM64 Windows build. On ARM64 the extension installs the x64
binary on Windows 11, where x64 emulation is available. Windows 10 on ARM
emulates x86 but not x64; the extension rejects that fallback and you must
[build from source](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/blob/main/docs/how-to/INSTALLATION.md).

On Linux, `auto` selects the GNU/glibc archive for mainstream distributions and
the musl archive for Alpine Linux or musl-based containers. Set
`perl-lsp.linuxLibc` to `gnu`, `glibc`, or `musl` only when you need to override
that detection.

### Enterprise / offline / air-gapped deployments

The extension downloads the Perl LSP server binary on first activation. If your environment blocks internet access during extension install or uses a strict proxy, see [`INTERNAL_DEPLOYMENT.md`](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/blob/master/vscode-extension/INTERNAL_DEPLOYMENT.md) for:

- Pre-downloading the binary and bundling it with your VSIX
- Using `perl-lsp.serverPath` to point at a shared binary
- Corporate proxy and certificate configuration

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to manage the binary yourself:

```bash
# Homebrew via the EffortlessMetrics tap (macOS/Linux)
brew install effortlessmetrics/tap/perllsp

# Identity-bound remote bootstrap once release closeout publishes ref+digest
INSTALLER_REF=<full-40-char-commit-sha>
INSTALLER_SHA256=<reviewed-sha256-of-scripts-install-sh>
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/$INSTALLER_REF/install.sh" \
  | PERL_LSP_INSTALLER_REF="$INSTALLER_REF" \
    PERL_LSP_INSTALLER_SHA256="$INSTALLER_SHA256" bash

# From source
cargo install --git https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp --package perllsp
```

Then point the extension to your `perllsp` binary via `perl-lsp.serverPath`.

## Troubleshooting

**Server not starting?**

1. Open the output channel: Command Palette > "Perl: Show Output Channel"
2. Check that `perllsp` is available: Command Palette > "Perl: Show Server Version"
3. If auto-download failed, check your network/proxy settings or install manually

**Formatting not working?**

- Check `perl-lsp.enableFormatting` is `true` (native formatting is the default; `perltidy` is not required)
- If you selected the external/compatibility formatter engine, ensure `perltidy` is installed and available in your PATH

**Diagnostics too noisy?**

- Run **Perl: Explain This Diagnostic** to see whether the warning is a
  true missing fact, low-confidence evidence, or a dynamic boundary.
- Run **Perl: Show Workspace Trust Report** if module paths, Perl binary,
  or setup policy may be involved.
- For Perl binary, `@INC`, `PERL5LIB`, perldoc, or DAP module-path mismatches,
  see the [Perl setup troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/blob/master/docs/how-to/PERL_SETUP_TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
- To suppress false-positive diagnostics, use **Perl: Copy Provider Decision Receipt** and file an issue with the copied receipt so the specific provider can be addressed.
- File an issue with the copied provider receipt if you see false positives.

## Known Issues

- Variable/watch rendering in debugger sessions is still evolving; complex Perl
  structures may appear with placeholder values in some scenarios.
- The `Format Document` shortcut (`Shift+Alt+F`) is provided by VS Code's
  built-in formatter binding. perl-lsp participates through the registered
  formatting provider. Set `perl-lsp.enableFormatting` to `false` to disable
  it (requires server restart).
- On first activation, environments with strict proxies or blocked outbound
  traffic may fail auto-download. Use `perl-lsp.serverPath` or
  `perl-lsp.downloadBaseUrl` for managed/internal deployment.

## Workspace Trust

perl-lsp **requires workspace trust** before downloading or spawning the
language server binary. In an untrusted workspace the extension:

- Does not auto-download the `perllsp` binary.
- Does not start the language server.
- Does not run background update checks.
- Blocks the **Reinstall Server Binary** and **Check for Binary Updates** commands.

When you grant trust to the workspace (VS Code's built-in trust prompt),
perl-lsp automatically starts the language server. This prevents untrusted
code from triggering binary downloads or spawning server processes. (#4631)
