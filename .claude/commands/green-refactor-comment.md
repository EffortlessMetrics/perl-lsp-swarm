# Green Refactor: Comment

Commit refactoring, push, set sign-off label, comment on PR.

## Steps

1. Push refactoring commits (should already be committed during simplify step):
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

2. Set sign-off label (verified apply — see `/label-apply-verified`):
   ```
   /label-apply-verified pr <number> "green-refactor-reviewed"
   ```

3. Comment on PR:
   ```bash
   gh pr comment <number> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
