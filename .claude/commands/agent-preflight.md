# Agent Preflight

Run the agent preflight checks to verify this worktree is safe to edit.

## Steps

Run the preflight script:

```bash
bash scripts/agent-preflight.sh
```

The script checks:

1. **Branch safety** — Not on `master` or `main`. Not in detached HEAD state. Exit 1 if failed.
2. **Worktree isolation** — Running inside a git worktree, not the main checkout. Exit 2 if failed.
3. **No merge conflicts** — No unresolved conflict markers in the working tree. Exit 3 if failed.
4. **cwd isolation** — Not running from the main repo root. Exit 4 if failed.
5. **CARGO_TARGET_DIR isolation** — Cargo's default (unconfigured) target-dir resolves to `<workspace-root>/target`, which for a `git worktree` checkout is this worktree's own directory — already isolated, automatically. **This check FAILS if `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is set** (exit 5): an env var set anywhere (including a stale line in a shell profile) overrides that per-worktree default for every subsequently-sourced shell, regardless of which worktree/branch it's actually in (issue #3854), redirecting builds to the wrong worktree. There is no legitimate reason to set it — unset it.
6. **No git stash entries** — Git stash is shared across all worktrees. Any entries risk cross-contamination between agents. Exit 6 if failed.

## Interpreting results

- **Exit 0**: All checks pass. Safe to begin work.
- **Exit 1 (branch issue)**: You are on a protected branch or detached HEAD.
  - Fix: Ensure the agent was spawned with `isolation: worktree` in the agent definition.
- **Exit 2 (worktree issue)**: Not in an isolated worktree.
  - Fix: Add `isolation: worktree` to the agent definition and respawn.
- **Exit 3 (conflict issue)**: Unresolved merge conflicts present.
  - Fix: Resolve conflicts manually, then re-run preflight.
- **Exit 4 (cwd issue)**: Running from the main repo root instead of the worktree.
  - Fix: cd to the worktree path.
- **Exit 5 (CARGO_TARGET_DIR issue)**: The env var is set, defeating automatic per-worktree isolation.
  - Fix: `unset CARGO_TARGET_DIR`. If it came from a shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`), remove that line — it's a stale leftover, not a setting to keep.
- **Exit 6 (stash issue)**: Shared stash has entries from this or other worktrees.
  - Fix: Run `git stash clear` to drop all entries. Never use `git stash` -- use `git restore <file>` to discard changes or `git commit -m "wip"` to save work.

## On failure

Do not proceed with edits. Report the failure to the orchestrator with the exact error message from the script. This prevents agents from accidentally editing the wrong branch or polluting the main checkout.
