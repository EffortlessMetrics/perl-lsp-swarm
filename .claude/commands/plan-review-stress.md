# Plan Review: Stress Test

Think adversarially about the scout's recommended approach.

## Synthesize with prior agents (do this BEFORE stress-testing)

You run after accuracy, research, oppositional, diaboli, architecture, and maintainer-issue — the complete verification stack. You are the final synthesis point before the spec becomes builder-ready. Your stress-test must reflect what the full stack found, not just the original issue body.

For each prior agent comment:

- **accuracy-scout** — file paths and function names corrected? Build your stress-test around the *corrected* details. If accuracy-scout found the spec was targeting wrong locations, stress-test the corrected approach.
- **research-verifier** — external claims verified or debunked? If Perl semantics, LSP spec, or crate API claims were debunked, the approach may need rethinking — surface that as a stress-test risk.
- **oppositional-planner** — alternatives surfaced? If a scope-pivot or simpler alternative was proposed and not addressed, either confirm why the original is better or incorporate the pivot into the plan.
- **architecture-reviewer** — ALIGNED / CONCERN / FAIL? If CONCERN or FAIL, the spec must resolve the structural issue before it can be builder-ready. If ALIGNED, the structural case is made — note it and move on.
- **advocatus-diaboli** — BUILD / DEFER / CLOSE? If DEFER, the plan must explain what changed since the diaboli verdict to warrant proceeding. If CLOSE, consider whether a reduced scope still makes sense.
- **maintainer-issue** — ALIGNED / DEFERRED / OUT OF SCOPE? If DEFERRED or OUT OF SCOPE, do not mark builder-ready — bounce to scout with the scope constraint.

**Your synthesis note in the final plan-review comment should explicitly name:** which prior-agent finding most changed your assessment, and what the builder must know that isn't visible in the original issue body.

## Steps

1. **What could go wrong with this fix?**
   - Could it break other code paths that use the same function?
   - Does it handle all variants of the construct, or just the sampled ones?
   - Could it cause regressions in existing tests?

2. **Is there a simpler approach?**
   - Read the surrounding code — is there an existing pattern for similar fixes?
   - Could a one-line change work instead of a multi-line refactor?
   - Are there other recent PRs that solved similar problems?

3. **Edge cases the scout might have missed:**
   - Nested versions of the construct
   - The construct inside strings/regex/heredocs
   - Unusual whitespace, comments, or line breaks
   - Empty or minimal versions

4. **Test completeness:**
   - Does the proposed test actually test the right thing?
   - Would it fail before the fix and pass after?
   - Are there edge case tests that should be added?

5. **What's missing from the spec?**
   - Is there enough detail for a builder to execute without research?
   - If not, **you'll add it in step 4** — note what needs filling in.

## Research Verification

Before approving the spec, check whether it makes any external claims. A spec is **claim-heavy** if it asserts ANY of the following:

- Perl language semantics (`our`, `my`, `local`, pragma behavior, signature semantics, regex flags)
- LSP 3.17/3.18 protocol behavior
- DAP protocol behavior
- External crate API behavior (tower-lsp, lsp-types, tree-sitter, etc.)
- “PR #NNNN closed this” or “this is fixed by commit SHA”
- Standard library function behavior that the fix depends on

**If ANY claim-heavy criterion is met:**
1. Dispatch the `research-verifier` agent on this issue before marking it builder-ready.
2. Wait for the `research-reviewed` label or a verification comment.
3. **Fallback — if network is unavailable:** add the `needs-research-verification` label to the issue instead of proceeding blind.

**If no external claims are made:** skip this step — no dispatch needed.

## Output

Record in your task:
```
Risk assessment: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH
Simpler alternative: NONE / <description>
Missed edge cases: NONE / <list>
Test improvements: NONE / <suggestions>
Research verification: SKIPPED (no external claims) / DISPATCHED / FALLBACK LABEL SET
Attribution check: SKIPPED (no attribution claims) / VERIFIED / FLAGGED (needs-git-history-check added)
```

## Attribution Check

If the issue body or scout's analysis contains ANY of the following phrases:
- "fixed by PR #NNNN"
- "already shipped in commit SHA"
- "this issue is stale / superseded by #NNNN"
- "closed by #NNNN"

Run the git-history check before proceeding:

```bash
# Verify the PR actually merged and closed the right issue
gh pr view <NNNN> --json state,mergedAt,closingIssuesReferences
# Verify the fix is present in master
git log --oneline master | grep -i <keyword>
```

> **MCP alternative (web/no-gh sessions):** `mcp__github__pull_request_read(method:"get", pullNumber:<NNNN>)` for state/mergedAt/closingIssues metadata.

**If claim checks out:** note `Attribution: VERIFIED` in your output.
**If claim is wrong:** remove or correct the attribution in the plan and issue. Add `needs-git-history-check` label to the issue for ops sweep.
**If uncertain:** add `needs-git-history-check` label, note it in the plan-review comment, and continue. Do not block on uncertainty — just flag it.
