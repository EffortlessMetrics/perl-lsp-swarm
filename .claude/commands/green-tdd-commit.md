   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   test(<crate>): add edge case and regression tests for #<issue> (green TDD)

   <list of test functions added and what they cover>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

3. Push:
   ```bash
   git push origin impl/<issue#>-<specslug>
   ```

5. **Set the sign-off label** (verified apply — see `/label-apply-verified`):
   ```
   /label-apply-verified issue <number> "green-tdd-reviewed"
   ```

6. If bugs were found (new tests fail), ALSO add the routing label (verified apply — see `/label-apply-verified`):
   ```
   /label-apply-verified issue <number> "needs-builder-fix"
   ```
