Goal manifest: [active.toml](../../.perl-lsp/goals/active.toml)

## Current State

- [parser accuracy next](../../docs/project/status/parser_accuracy_next.md)
  reports 0 active failure packets and no measurement gaps.
- Parser bucket capability work routes through
  [parser raw failure buckets](../../docs/project/status/parser.md#raw-failure-buckets)
  only when generated parser status lists a nonzero raw bucket or a current
  source-backed fixture fails against the parser. When parser status lists
  `none`, do not start raw-bucket work from stale context.
- Raw bucket counts are point-in-time corpus receipt data. Fixture-only PRs may
  lock source-backed shapes, but only fresh corpus receipts may claim bucket
  movement.
- Provider confidence work routes through
  [provider confidence matrix](../../docs/project/status/provider_confidence_matrix.md),
  [provider cutover](../../docs/project/status/provider_cutover.md),
  [semantic scorecard](../../docs/project/status/semantic_scorecard.md),
  [semantic shadow compare](../../docs/project/status/semantic_shadow_compare.md),
  and [UX capability dashboard](../../docs/project/status/ux_capability_dashboard.md).
- User-facing support claims route through
  [SUPPORT_TIERS.md](../../docs/project/status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md), which maps
  claims to proof commands, status docs, limitations, and next promotion proof.

## Work item: raw-bucket-fixture-lane

Status: deferred while generated parser status lists no nonzero raw bucket
Linked proposal: [PLSP-PROP-0001](../../docs/proposals/PLSP-PROP-0001-real-perl-editor-trust.md)
Linked spec: [PLSP-SPEC-0001](../../docs/specs/PLSP-SPEC-0001-parser-compatibility-bucket-closeout.md), [PLSP-SPEC-0004](../../docs/specs/PLSP-SPEC-0004-corpus-receipt-freshness.md)
Linked ADR: [PLSP-ADR-0001](../../docs/adr/PLSP-ADR-0001-generated-status-is-control-plane.md)
Blocks: none until a current nonzero raw bucket or failing fixture reopens it
Blocked by: generated parser status listing no nonzero raw bucket

Goal

Do not start raw-bucket work while generated parser status lists `none`. Resume
source-backed fixture or narrow parser-fix work only from a fresh Linux corpus
receipt, a generated nonzero raw bucket, or a focused source-backed fixture that
fails against the current parser.

Historical shape analysis:
[unclosed_paren_identifier shape analysis](../../docs/project/status/parser_unclosed_paren_identifier_shapes.md).
AST boundary receipts:
`../../crates/perl-parser-core/tests/list_operator_boundary_receipts.rs`.

Next parser runtime work should start only from current failing evidence: a
fresh Linux receipt or a focused source-backed fixture that fails against the
current parser. Otherwise the deferred Linux corpus refresh owns bucket-count
movement.

Production delta

When this lane is reopened, each PR locks one real-Perl parser shape or fixes
one narrow parser behavior with focused tests.

Non-goals

No bucket-count reduction claim without a refreshed corpus receipt. No parser
runtime change in fixture-only PRs.

Acceptance

When this lane is reopened, each PR names the generated status pointer, states
receipt freshness, keeps the scope PR-sized, and states allowed and unproven
claims. If generated status still lists `none`, the PR must identify a current
failing source-backed fixture instead of a stale bucket name.

Proof commands

```bash
cargo test -p perl-parser-core --test <bucket-test> --profile agent --locked -- --nocapture
cargo test -p perl-parser-core --test list_operator_boundary_receipts --profile agent --locked -- --nocapture
cargo xtask metrics parser-accuracy --check
cargo xtask update-status --only parser --check
cargo xtask metrics ratchet-check parser_accuracy
cargo xtask fmt --check
git diff --check
```

Rollback

Revert the focused fixture/fix PR. If a parser behavior fix regresses corpus
status, revert behavior first and leave fixture evidence for follow-up.

## Work item: linux-corpus-refresh

Status: deferred on Windows; successor Linux corpus refresh
Linked proposal: [PLSP-PROP-0001](../../docs/proposals/PLSP-PROP-0001-real-perl-editor-trust.md)
Linked spec: [PLSP-SPEC-0004](../../docs/specs/PLSP-SPEC-0004-corpus-receipt-freshness.md)
Linked ADR: [PLSP-ADR-0001](../../docs/adr/PLSP-ADR-0001-generated-status-is-control-plane.md)
Blocks: none for this closeout; successor Linux corpus refresh owns future
bucket-count claims
Blocked by: Linux system-Perl roots unavailable on this Windows host

Goal

Refresh the Linux system-Perl corpus receipt so raw bucket movement can be
claimed or explicitly deferred.

Production delta

Generated parser status reflects a current corpus sweep.

Non-goals

No parser runtime behavior change, fixture addition, provider change, or support
claim promotion in the refresh PR.

Acceptance

Corpus sweep completes on Linux, generated parser status is updated through
tooling, and the PR states bucket-count claims limited to that receipt.

Deferral note

The current Windows worktree does not have the Linux system roots named by the
stale receipt (`/usr/share/perl`, `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl`, and
`/usr/share/perl5`). The refresh is deferred to a dedicated Linux corpus
refresh lane and must run on a Linux host before any parser bucket-count
movement is claimed.

Proof commands

```bash
cargo xtask parser-corpus-sweep --baseline .ci/parser-corpus-baseline.json --enforce --receipt
cargo xtask update-status --only parser --write
cargo xtask update-status --only parser --check
cargo xtask metrics ratchet-check parser_accuracy
git diff --check
```

Rollback

Revert generated receipt/status updates. If Linux roots are unavailable, close
with an explicit deferral note and keep fixture-only work in scope.

## Work item: real-workspace-baseline-run

Status: completed; receipt [2026-05-13 Mojolicious Windows baseline](../../docs/forensics/2026-05-13-real-workspace-baseline-mojolicious.md)

Blocks: provider-confidence-closeout, support-claim-refresh
Blocked by: real-workspace-baseline-spec

Goal

Record at least one real-workspace baseline that proves cold start, indexing,
module resolution, provider behavior, and confidence boundaries.

Production delta

Recorded a current Mojolicious Windows editor-latency receipt, refreshed the
raw latency JSON for that fixture, and updated the report generator/template to
state provider coverage, explicit deferrals, confidence/status links, outlier
interpretation, and claim boundaries.

Non-goals

No all-CPAN claim, no hidden network dependency for ordinary PRs, and no live
provider cutover from one baseline.

Acceptance

Baseline names the project/source, host/toolchain context, provider surfaces
covered or deferred, confidence/freshness links, and claim boundary.

Proof commands

```bash
just real-workspace-baseline mojolicious
cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs --test real_project_latency mojolicious -- --include-ignored --nocapture
cargo xtask semantic-scorecard --check
cargo xtask semantic-shadow-compare --check
git diff --check
```

Rollback

Revert the receipt/status link. If the baseline exposes a failure, keep the
failure as a blocker issue and do not promote the claim.

Blocks: support-claim-refresh, lane-closeout
Blocked by: confidence-before-cutover-adr, real-workspace-baseline-run when project-scale proof is required

Goal

Close provider confidence gaps by ensuring provider surfaces have source,
provenance, confidence, freshness, fallback, blocker, and live-comparison
receipts before broader cutover.

Production delta

Added [provider confidence matrix](../../docs/project/status/provider_confidence_matrix.md),
a row-per-provider status surface that records fact source/provenance,
confidence/freshness boundaries, fallback/blocker behavior, runtime/live
comparison receipts, real-workspace links, current live state, and next proof.

Non-goals

No broad live provider cutover without the cutover requirements. No parser
bucket or corpus refresh work.

Acceptance

Provider confidence matrix records provider, fact source, confidence, freshness,
fallback, runtime receipt, live cutover state, real-workspace link, and next
proof.

Proof commands

```bash
cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs-core --lib rename_shadow safe_delete_shadow -- --nocapture
cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs --lib refactor_runtime_blocker -- --nocapture
cargo xtask semantic-scorecard --check
cargo xtask semantic-shadow-compare --check

Rollback

Revert the provider receipt/status PR. If a provider proof is unsafe, leave the
provider shadowed or blocked and file a narrow follow-up.

Blocks: lane-closeout
Blocked by: linux-corpus-refresh when parser claims change; provider-confidence-closeout when provider claims change; real-workspace-baseline-run when workspace claims change

Goal

Map user-facing LSP capability claims to proof commands, status docs, known
limitations, and next promotion proof.

Production delta

Added [SUPPORT_TIERS.md](../../docs/project/status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md), a
user-facing claim map for parser compatibility, module resolution, provider
surfaces, DAP subprocess seams, and real-workspace receipts. Each row links the
allowed claim to proof commands, status docs, known limitations, and next
promotion proof.

Non-goals

No new parser or provider behavior. No unsupported full-CPAN or broad live
cutover claim.

Acceptance

Support/status rows link claims to proof commands and status docs, with known
limitations and next promotion proof.

Proof commands

```bash
cargo xtask update-status --only parser --check
cargo xtask semantic-scorecard --check
cargo xtask semantic-shadow-compare --check
git diff --check
```

Rollback

Revert the support/status claim PR. If proof is stale, demote the claim and keep
the limitation visible.

## Work item: lane-closeout

Status: completed; issue #8866
Linked proposal: [PLSP-PROP-0001](../../docs/proposals/PLSP-PROP-0001-real-perl-editor-trust.md)
Linked spec: all Real Perl Editor Trust specs
Linked ADR: all Real Perl Editor Trust ADRs
Blocks: none
Blocked by: none

Goal

Close the lane when repo artifacts let agents choose the next parser, provider,
real-workspace, and support-claim work without chat history.

Production delta

The repo has proposal, specs, ADRs, plan, active goal manifest, generated status
pointers, and proof receipts aligned.

Non-goals

No new behavior, parser rewrite, full CPAN-clean claim, or live provider cutover
without its own proof.

Acceptance

Active manifest points to this plan and current status docs; implementation plan
has no missing required fields; status/support surfaces link claims to proof;
deferred items name successor work.

Completion audit

- Source-of-truth stack: proposal, specs, ADRs, implementation plan, and active
  goal manifest are present.
- Parser control plane: `parser_accuracy_next.md` reports 0 active failure
  packets and hands capability work to `parser.md#raw-failure-buckets` only
  when generated parser status lists a nonzero raw bucket.
- Parser claim boundary: current generated parser status lists no nonzero raw
  bucket, so raw-bucket fixture work is not active from stale context. Future
  parser fixture/fix work must start from a fresh Linux corpus receipt, a
  generated nonzero raw bucket, or a current failing source-backed fixture and
  must not claim bucket-count movement without regenerated corpus proof.
- Linux corpus refresh: deferred on this Windows host because the Linux
  system-Perl roots are unavailable; a dedicated Linux corpus refresh lane owns
  the fresh receipt.
- Provider confidence: `provider_confidence_matrix.md` maps provider source,
  confidence, freshness, fallback, runtime comparison, real-workspace links,
  live state, and next proof.
- Real-workspace proof: the Mojolicious and Dancer2 Windows receipts record the
  covered editor-latency surfaces and explicit deferrals; the real-project
  resource receipt records fixture file, line, and byte shape while leaving RSS
  and heap ceilings to memory plateau receipts.
- Support claims: `SUPPORT_TIERS.md` maps user-facing claims to proof commands,
  status docs, known limitations, and next promotion proof.

Proof commands

```bash
cargo run -p xtask -- parser-corpus-sweep --manifest .ci/common-corpus-manifest.txt --enforce --receipt
cargo xtask update-status --only parser --check
cargo xtask semantic-scorecard --check
cargo xtask semantic-shadow-compare --check
git diff --check
```

Rollback

Reopen the lane by changing the manifest status back to active and adding a
specific ready work item with proof commands and claim boundaries.

## Swarm Execution Follow-Up Queue

Status: active through [active.toml](../../.perl-lsp/goals/active.toml)

This section records the current swarm handoff after the original closeout. The
active goal manifest is the machine-readable source of truth; this plan only
states the PR order and claim boundary.

Recent routing

- `semantic-token-scoped-class-proof` is completed. The phase-block declaration
  proof added the scoped `token:phase_block_declaration:` class only when its
  source-backed span matches an existing live `macro` token, refreshes after
  `didChange`, and emits no new token output.
- `constant-provider-proof` is completed. The substrate proof hardened static
  `use constant` extraction for scalar, quoted scalar, hash, quoted-hash,
  plus-hash, and nested-value hash forms and recorded a completion shadow trace
  for constants as fresh `CompilerFact` / `SemanticAnalyzer` evidence without
  changing live completion behavior.
- `semantic-token-support-review` is completed. The class registry, human
  provider-promotion ledger, and machine ledger now agree on the scoped
  lexical-variable declaration/use rows, while semantic tokens remain
  output-neutral and `partial-live-with-fallback`.
- `prototype-table` is completed. HIR now records named subroutine prototype
  content and precise source ranges in a prototype table, and
  `RegisterPrototype` compile effects derive from that table without changing
  provider behavior, diagnostics, parser bucket claims, support tiers, PIR
  state, or determinism claims.
- `bareword-classifier` is completed. HIR now records source-backed syntactic
  roles for parsed identifier barewords without changing PL109 suppression,
  provider behavior, parser bucket claims, support tiers, PIR state, or
  determinism claims.
- `determinism-receipt-v1-spec` is completed. `PLSP-SPEC-0026` now defines the
  determinism receipt v1 contract, input classes, valid/invalid PR shapes,
  acceptance, proof commands, non-goals, and claim boundaries without adding a
  receipt generator, PIR implementation, runtime probe, provider behavior,
  support-tier promotion, release-lineage sync, or determinism claim.

Current executable slice

- `differential-oracle-contract` is active in the substrate lane.
- The slice defines `PLSP-SPEC-0027` as the differential oracle contract and
  links it from the existing fact-provenance, module-path, ambient-input,
  determinism, compiler-fact, dashboard, and active-goal surfaces.

Claim boundary

- Differential oracle contract work is spec/planning proof only.
- Do not add real-Perl runtime dependency, workspace probing, provider behavior,
  release-lineage sync, support-tier promotion, corpus/parser bucket movement,
  or determinism claims from this substrate slice.

Rollback

Revert the manifest/plan routing PR. If differential oracle contract work is not
ready, mark `differential-oracle-contract` planned or deferred in the active
manifest and select the next ready item without changing provider behavior.
