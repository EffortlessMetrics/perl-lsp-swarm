Welcome to the perl-lsp project! This guide will get you up to speed quickly.

## 📍 You Are Here

**Project Status**: v0.10.0 close-out receipts captured; v0.9.x hardening underway
**Open Issues**: See GitHub milestones/issues for live counts

## 🎯 5-Minute Orientation

### What Is This Project?

perl-lsp is a comprehensive Perl parsing + LSP/DAP ecosystem:
- Fast native Rust parser with near-complete Perl 5 coverage
- LSP server with broad feature support (tracked in `features.toml`)
- DAP support with native preview adapter + BridgeAdapter compatibility path
- Quality gates: tests, fuzzing/mutation hardening, missing_docs enforcement (see `CURRENT_STATUS.md`)

### Current Focus

**Now (post v0.10.0 close-out)**
- Keep close-out receipts green (`just ci-gate`, targeted state-machine tests, benchmark checks)
- Publish benchmark outputs under `benchmarks/results/`

**Next (v0.10.0)**
- Stability statement + packaging stance
- Benchmark publication with receipts
- Upgrade notes from v0.8.x → v0.9.x

**Later (post v0.9.x)**
- DAP preview hardening (runtime variable/evaluate depth + packaging)
- Full LSP 3.18 compliance (historical declaration; evidence-backed status tracked in #6731)
- Package manager distribution

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for milestones and exit criteria.

## 🚨 What Needs Attention RIGHT NOW

### Now (as of 2026-02-16)
1. 🟡 **Benchmark publication** - commit canonical benchmark outputs under `benchmarks/results/`
2. 🟡 **v0.9.x packaging stance** - finalize supported platforms and shipping model
3. 🟡 **Upgrade notes polish** - ensure v0.8.x → v0.9.x path is explicit
4. 📌 **Expanded backlog** - see `docs/TODO.md` + `docs/reference/LSP_MISSING_FEATURES_REPORT.md`

### Next
1. **v0.9.x readiness** - stability statement, packaging stance, benchmark receipts, upgrade notes
2. **Merge gates** - #210 after CI pipeline cleanup (#211)

### Critical Blockers / Constraints
- **Issue #211**: CI Pipeline cleanup blocks merge gates (#210)

## 💡 Where to Start Contributing

- Check the active milestone and the `good first issue` / `help wanted` labels
- Near-term work: benchmark publication + v0.9.x packaging/readiness (see ROADMAP)
- Larger efforts: v0.9.x milestone and `phase:*` labels
- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for workflow details

## 📊 Quality Metrics

All metrics are computed and published in [CURRENT_STATUS.md](CURRENT_STATUS.md).
Run `just status-check` for live numbers.

## 🔍 Understanding the Codebase

### Parser Architecture
- **v3 Native Parser** ⭐ RECOMMENDED: near-complete Perl 5 coverage with strong performance (see CURRENT_STATUS)
- **v2 Pest Parser**: Legacy but stable; maintained for compatibility
- **Incremental Parsing**: Sub-millisecond updates with high node reuse (see CURRENT_STATUS)

### LSP Components
- **Providers**: completion, hover, diagnostics, references, etc.
- **Workspace Index**: Dual indexing for qualified + bare symbol forms
- **Threading**: Adaptive threading to stabilize CI environments
- **Cancellation**: Enhanced system (PR #165)

### Key Innovations
- **Dual Indexing** (PR #122): Functions indexed as both `Package::function` and `function`
- **Adaptive Threading** (PR #140): Thread-aware timeout scaling for CI
- **API Documentation** (PR #160/SPEC-149): `#![warn(missing_docs)]` enforcement
- **Mutation Testing** (PR #153): Comprehensive mutation hardening suite
