# Introduction

Welcome to the **perl-lsp** documentation! This project provides a comprehensive Perl parsing and IDE support ecosystem built with modern Rust technologies.

## What is perl-lsp?

perl-lsp is a Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation for Perl 5, offering:

- **Fast Native Parser**: Built with Rust for near-complete Perl 5 syntax coverage (~100%)
- **LSP Server**: Full-featured language server with autocompletion, go-to-definition, refactoring, and more
- **Debug Adapter**: DAP support for debugging Perl applications
- **Multiple Crates**: Modular architecture with specialized components for parsing, lexing, and IDE integration
- **Quality Focus**: Comprehensive testing, mutation hardening, and API documentation enforcement

## Key Features

### Parser (perl-parser)
- Near-complete Perl 5 syntax coverage
- Tree-sitter compatible S-expression output
- Incremental parsing with sub-millisecond updates
- Robust error recovery

### LSP Server (perl-lsp)
- Autocompletion and signature help
- Go-to-definition and find-references
- Workspace-wide symbol navigation
- Rename refactoring with dual indexing
- Hover documentation
- Diagnostic reporting
- Code actions and workspace commands

### Debug Adapter (perl-dap)
- Native CLI debugging interface
- BridgeAdapter for IDE integration
- Breakpoint management and validation
- Stack trace inspection
- Security features

## Project Status

**Latest Release**: v0.17.0
**API Stability**: See [Stability Statement](./reference/stability.md)
**Current Milestone**: v0.17.0 (Public Alpha)

The project is actively developed with a focus on correctness, comprehensive testing, and thorough quality assurance. A formal Stability Contract is targeted for v0.15.0.

## Architecture

The perl-lsp ecosystem consists of five specialized crates:

1. **perl-parser**: Core parsing library with LSP provider traits
2. **perl-lsp**: Standalone LSP server binary
3. **perl-dap**: Debug Adapter Protocol implementation
4. **perl-lexer**: Context-aware tokenizer
5. **perl-corpus**: Comprehensive test corpus

See the [Architecture section](./architecture/overview.md) for detailed design documentation.
