# Safe git pull that handles untracked file conflicts and stale branch tracking.
#
# Problem: `git pull` fails when the remote adds files that already exist locally
# as untracked files (common with generated files, worktree leftovers, etc.).
# Additionally, `@{u}` (upstream tracking ref) can be stale or missing, causing
# scripts that rely on it to fail silently.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/safe-pull.sh              # pull from origin/main
#   scripts/safe-pull.sh my-branch    # pull from origin/my-branch
