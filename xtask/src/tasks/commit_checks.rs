//! Commit-tier staged checks (issue #3786, the first buildable slice of the
//! commit-gate feedback ladder).
//!
//! Every check here answers exactly one question: *is the staged artifact
//! structurally sound?* — never anything about orchestration-runtime
//! internals (agent counts, fan-out, launch topology; that boundary is
//! #3993/#3949 and stays out of this module on purpose), and never anything
//! that requires compiling the workspace (that's the pre-push tier, #3985).
//!
//! # Staged tree, never the working tree — and never the live index either
//!
//! Every check reads content through [`crate::tasks::staged`] — `git
//! write-tree` / `git ls-tree` / `git show` — never `fs::read_to_string` and
//! never a working-tree `WalkDir`. Beyond that: every check receives the
//! `tree_oid` that `gates::plan_gates` already captured once (threaded
//! through [`run_named_check`]'s `tree_oid` parameter) and reads from that
//! frozen tree object, never re-derives its own `git write-tree` or falls
//! back to the live index (`git diff --cached`, `git show :path`) — see
//! `staged.rs`'s module docs for why (a concurrent `git add` between
//! planning and dispatch must not make a check inspect a different state
//! than the receipt records).
//!
//! # Output shape
//!
//! Every check that has something to report returns a [`CheckReport`]
//! following `docs/reference/GUIDANCE_STYLE.md` §4/§5: result, why it
//! matters, affected artifacts, the fix (when mechanical), the exact rerun
//! command, and what remains required later. [`CheckReport::render`] embeds
//! the report as JSON behind a stable marker inside `GateResult.output_summary`
//! so `gates::build_agent_receipt` can reconstruct it into the action packet
//! (`AgentReceipt.advisories` / the enriched `AgentFailure` fields) without a
//! second parallel execution path.
//!
//! # Advisory-first (V1)
//!
//! Only [`Posture::Blocked`] fails a commit-tier gate. `CLASSIFICATION
//! REQUIRED`, `ADVISORY`, and `NOT PROVEN` are recorded but never block —
//! the advisory-to-blocking arming clock is a later PR (mirrors
//! `policy/changelog.toml`'s `blocking_enforced_from` pattern). `STOP`
//! (GUIDANCE_STYLE's fifth, safety/irreversibility posture) is reserved for
//! a staged-secret hazard; no check in this program asserts one.
