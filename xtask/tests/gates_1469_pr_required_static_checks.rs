//! RED TDD tests for issue #1469: Static checks required on PRs.
//!
//! These tests verify that:
//! - compile_all_targets is in pr_fast tier (moved from merge_gate)
//! - clippy_full is in pr_fast tier (moved from merge_gate)
//! - unit_routed_full gate exists in pr_fast tier (new gate)
//! - unit_routed_full uses --tests (not --lib) to catch integration test runtime failures
//! - No duplicate gate definitions across tiers
//! - GitHub Actions workflow matrix includes these gates on PRs
