# Release History

Canonical release ledger for [perl-lsp](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp).

This file is:
- **Backwards-looking** — records what shipped, not what is planned
- **Append-only** — rows are not rewritten; corrections are additive with notes
- **Cross-channel** — tracks GitHub assets, crates.io, editor marketplaces, and containers

GitHub Release `publishedAt` is used as the release date when available.
Tag commit timestamps may differ from release dates.

## Lineage corrections

### 2026-07-12 — 0.13 release boundaries

The ledger rows are append-only. The following corrections supersede the cited
cells without erasing the original record. The rows above are retained as
historical snapshots; use the corrected interpretations below for current
lineage and publication claims.

| Entry | Original ledger statement | Corrected interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| `0.13.1` predecessor | `v0.13.0` | No final `v0.13.0` tag exists. The actual predecessor is `v0.13.0-rc1`; use [v0.13.0-rc1...v0.13.1]. |
| `0.13.4` artifact | Tagged release with assets pending | No `v0.13.4` ref exists. This was a prepared/versioned changelog milestone, not a distinct tagged artifact. Its historical note is retained as a source-state inventory. |
| `0.14.0` predecessor | `v0.13.4` | The previous actual tag is `v0.13.3`; use [v0.13.3...v0.14.0]. That cumulative comparison includes the untagged 0.13.4 milestone and is not a narrow 0.14-only logical ledger. |

The original `v0.13.4` asset count and channel cells are not evidence of a
standalone 0.13.4 publication and should not be used as such.

### 2026-07-12 — live tag SHA and branch-line audit

The live ref audit found that several tag SHAs previously written in this ledger
or standalone release notes no longer match the commit reached by the named tag.
For multiple affected releases, the originally recorded full SHA no longer
resolves in the repository.

The complete immutable inventory is maintained in
[`policy/release-tag-provenance.toml`](policy/release-tag-provenance.toml), with
human guidance in [`docs/releases/TAG_PROVENANCE.md`](docs/releases/TAG_PROVENANCE.md).
The original rows above remain unchanged as historical evidence.

Key corrections:

- the current tags from `v0.1.0-pest` through `v0.8.5` are linear even though
  most of their recorded SHAs are stale;
- `v0.8.5` and `v0.9.1` are divergent, so their GitHub comparison is not a
  forward release range;
- `v0.11.0` descends from `v0.9.1`, not from the divergent `v0.8.5` line;
- the live refs for `v0.15.0`, `v0.16.0`, and `v0.17.0` are now pinned in the
  provenance manifest instead of remaining `pending` only;
- affected `Tag commit` cells in the original table are prior recorded values,
  not current live-ref truth. Use the provenance manifest for current SHAs.

No cause, actor, or rewrite date is inferred from the mismatch. The correction
records observable repository state and installs a drift guard.

## Release-channel corrections

### 2026-07-12 — v0.15.0 through v0.17.0 release-channel actuals

The original ledger rows remain visible as historical records. The following
facts supersede their `pending` GitHub Release, release-date, live-tag, asset, and
selected channel cells where stated:

| Version | GitHub Release actual | Live tag commit | Asset accounting at audit | Other channel boundary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0.15.0` | [published 2026-05-22][gh-0.15.0] | `ac8e281e73c6e14ae9d94ddf010ae0d45d1187d2` | GitHub UI reported 12 entries, including its two generated source archives; uploaded-artifact inventory was not separately reconciled. | crates.io and editor marketplaces remain unreconciled. Docker Hub builder/runtime tags expose `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`; GHCR builder/runtime tags exist but are `linux/arm64`-only. |
| `0.15.1` | [published 2026-05-26][gh-0.15.1] | `15cbe7e6295a67ea0cba506c3cade628ee4847f6` | GitHub UI reported 12 entries, including its two generated source archives; uploaded-artifact inventory was not separately reconciled. | GitHub binaries remain usable. The crates.io package is superseded by `0.15.2` for fresh Cargo installs; marketplace state remains unreconciled. Docker Hub is amd64/arm64; GHCR is arm64-only. |
| `0.15.2` | [published 2026-05-26][gh-0.15.2] | `746edcb78fe0fa8f48d87386fd4f110502588a87` | Original closeout verified 10 uploaded artifacts; GitHub UI reported 12 entries after including its two generated source archives. | PR #9617 verified crates.io install smokes, VS Code Marketplace, Open VSX, and Docker Hub. A later authenticated audit resolved GHCR as published but incomplete: both tags are arm64-only and lack amd64. |
| `0.16.0` | [published 2026-06-06][gh-0.16.0] | `b6d9f12b995ad8ad78ca641940bd73e4b1a3c26d` | GitHub UI reported 11 entries, including its two generated source archives; uploaded-artifact inventory was not separately reconciled. | crates.io and editor marketplaces remain unreconciled. Docker Hub builder/runtime tags expose amd64/arm64; GHCR builder/runtime tags are arm64-only. |
| `0.17.0` | [published 2026-06-28][gh-0.17.0] | `ffee2824938f415e54923112c7b79e3f22040699` | GitHub UI reported 12 entries, including its two generated source archives; uploaded-artifact inventory was not separately reconciled. | crates.io and editor marketplaces remain unreconciled. Docker Hub builder/runtime tags expose amd64/arm64; GHCR builder/runtime tags are arm64-only. |

GitHub's rendered `Assets N` value and this ledger's uploaded-artifact count are
not interchangeable. The UI total includes the generated source ZIP and tarball;
the ledger records uploaded artifacts only when an independent inventory or
closeout receipt exists.

The note-level channel actuals and restored `v0.15.2` closeout receipt are tracked
in #9965. The container classifications come from the read-only registry audit in
#9973 (workflow runs `29192188862` and `29192323459`); #9972 fixes the GHCR
multi-architecture publishing defect going forward. A GitHub Release page alone
is not evidence that crates.io, Marketplace, Open VSX, Docker Hub, or GHCR
completed.

### 2026-07-17 — v0.17.0 receipt verification

Verified the GitHub Release published 2026-06-28 at
`ffee2824938f415e54923112c7b79e3f22040699`, with seven platform archives,
VSIX, `SHA256SUMS`, and SPDX SBOM. The existing crates.io and VS Code
Marketplace cells are historical assertions without current receipts and
remain **not proven**; Homebrew, Open VSX, and Docker are also not proven by
this GitHub receipt.

### 2026-07-22 — v0.16.0 corrected to skipped (RETRACTED — see 2026-07-25)

The 2026-07-12 release-channel audit above recorded a GitHub Release for
`0.16.0` published 2026-06-06 at tag commit
`b6d9f12b995ad8ad78ca641940bd73e4b1a3c26d`. A later pass found **no `v0.16.0`
tag, GitHub Release, or crates.io publication exists**. The changes planned for
0.16.0 shipped as part of 0.17.0 instead (see `CHANGELOG.md`
`## [0.16.0] - Skipped (rolled into 0.17.0)`). The top ledger row for `0.16.0`
is marked **skipped** accordingly; the 2026-07-12 entry above is retained as a
superseded historical snapshot, not current lineage truth.

### 2026-07-25 — v0.16.0 skipped-status RETRACTED; 0.16.0 did ship

**The 2026-07-22 entry above is wrong and is retracted.** Its claim that "no
`v0.16.0` tag, GitHub Release, or crates.io publication exists" is false in all
three parts. The 2026-07-12 release-channel audit it superseded was correct,
including its date and tag commit.

Verified against live external sources, not repository contents:

| Claim | Verification | Result |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| Git tag | `git ls-remote --tags` | `refs/tags/v0.16.0` → `b6d9f12b995ad8ad78ca641940bd73e4b1a3c26d` — exactly the SHA the 2026-07-12 audit cited |
| GitHub Release | `repos/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/releases/tags/v0.16.0` | published `2026-06-06T16:58:07Z`, `draft: false`, `prerelease: false`, 9 assets |
| crates.io | `crates.io/api/v1/crates/perllsp/versions` | `0.16.0` published `2026-06-06`, `yanked: false` |

The top ledger row for `0.16.0` is restored to shipped with these values.

**Why this matters beyond one row.** The 2026-07-22 error was self-reinforcing:
it wrote the skipped status into the ledger *and* into `CHANGELOG.md`
(`## [0.16.0] - Skipped`), so the repository then corroborated itself. Any later
check confined to repository contents would confirm the error rather than catch
it. Release-lineage facts must be verified against the tag, the release API, and
the registry — the tree is not evidence about what shipped.

## Legend

- **"—"** = does not exist / not applicable
- **"deferred"** = release published to GitHub but crates.io publish intentionally postponed
- **"skipped"** = version number was reserved but never released; changes rolled into a later version
- **"unreconciled"** = a tag exists, but GitHub Release and channel state have not been independently closed out
- **"(CL)"** = date from CHANGELOG only (no tag or release exists)
- **"(tag)"** = date from tag commit (no verified GitHub Release date)
- Versions without a tag or GitHub Release are CHANGELOG-only scope markers that never shipped as distinct artifacts
- The v0.11.0 release included two VSIX files (`perl-lsp-0.11.0.vsix` and `perl-lsp-rs-0.11.0.vsix`) due to the extension rename

## Eras
