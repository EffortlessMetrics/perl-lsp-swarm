## [Unreleased]

<!-- changelog coverage: retrospective_covered_through = da86c123a (this PR's
     base commit, conservative floor for the audited range). Post-audit
     user-facing PRs merged after this PR was authored are NOT covered here
     and are bridge-backfill candidates for the Changie ledger (#3784). -->

### Changed

- **Breaking (`perl-ast`): `Node` now implements `Drop`, so direct
  by-value field moves out of a `Node` no longer compile (E0509).**
  Destruction is iterative and depth-independent (#8836): dropping any tree
  shape releases every original node exactly once with bounded call-stack
  usage, so adversarially deep publicly constructed trees can no longer abort
  the process through recursive drop glue. Borrow-based matching on
  `node.kind` is unchanged. For by-value consumption, use the new
  `Node::into_parts(self) -> (NodeKind, SourceLocation)`, which preserves the
  original move economics without cloning; in-repo consumers (hash/block
  disambiguation, inline dereference bodies, statement dispatch) were
  migrated to it. Destructor order is intentionally unspecified.

- **Breaking (`perl-lsp-rs-core`): `JsonRpcResponse::jsonrpc` is now
  `&'static str`.** Always `"2.0"` (see `JSONRPC_VERSION`); removes a
  per-response `String` allocation (#5053 item 7). Struct literals that
  passed `"2.0".to_string()` must pass `"2.0"`. Wire JSON is unchanged
  (serde serializes `&str` identically to `String`).

- **Breaking (`perl-lsp-rs-core`): `AiCompletionConfig` / `AiStreamingConfig`
  authority fields.** Public structs now carry `user_enabled` /
  `project_opt_out` (and streaming `user_enabled`) so project `.perl-lsp.toml`
  can only opt out of AI, never enable it (#4997 / #5022). Exhaustive struct
  literals must set the new fields or use `..Default::default()`. Semver minor
  bump lands with the next published release; `Default` is implemented for
  migration. See [docs/reference/AI_COMPLETION.md](docs/reference/AI_COMPLETION.md).

- **VS Code extension toolchain modernized to TypeScript 7 / Oxc / Rolldown**,
  shrinking the packaged VSIX by ~77% (1.25 MB to 291 KB). See
  [vscode-extension/CHANGELOG.md](vscode-extension/CHANGELOG.md) for detail.
  (#3645, #3690, #3721, #3736, #3755)

### Added

- **Test2 framework awareness (reader/integration, not a Test2 runtime).**
  `perl-lsp` now reads Test2 source and Test2 runner output and drives the
  project's real runner, without replacing `yath`/`prove`/`perl` or executing
  `subtest` blocks in isolation:
  - **Imports** — `use Test2::V0;` (and common `Test2::Tools::*`) are understood
    so assertions like `ok`/`is`/`subtest`/`done_testing` are in scope, with
    exclusion (`!ok`), rename (`ok => {-as => 'my_ok'}`), and
    `-no_strict`/`-no_warnings`/`-no_pragmas` handled. Export lists are verified
    against the canonical Test2-Suite source.
  - **Critic** — `use Test2::V0;` satisfies the native `require_use_strict` /
    `require_use_warnings` rules (unless disabled via an import option).
  - **Subtest structure** — nested subtests are discovered as a tree and appear
    in the document-symbol outline and code lenses; dynamic names are reported
    as dynamic rather than guessed.
  - **TAP output** — runner output is parsed into structured failures mapped to
    source (`file`/`line`/`got`/`expected`); TODO/SKIP are not hard failures;
    raw output/exit code/runner are preserved.
  - **Run/Debug** — "Run Subtest" runs the whole file and focuses output on the
    named subtest; `perl.debugTestFile` returns a real `perl-dap` launch
    configuration for `.t` files (replacing the previous placeholder). Test2
    editor snippets (`usetest2`, `dies`, `lives`)
    are shipped. See [docs/reference/TEST2_INTEGRATION.md](docs/reference/TEST2_INTEGRATION.md).
- **Hover docs and completion for Perl 5.36–5.40 `use builtin` functions.**
  All 16 functions introduced by the `builtin` pragma (`true`/`false`/
  `is_bool`, `weaken`/`unweaken`/`is_weak`, `refaddr`/`reftype`,
  `ceil`/`floor`, `inf`/`nan`, `trim`, `indexed`, `load_module`,
  `export_lexically`) now have typed signatures, versioned descriptions, and
  resolve identically whether called bare or as `builtin::name(...)`.
  (#3118) `blessed` (5.36) and `is_tainted` (5.38) were added to the same
  catalog. (#3275)
- **`textDocument/semanticTokens/full/delta` support.** The server previously
  advertised `semanticTokensProvider.full` with no working delta handler and no
  `resultId`, so delta-capable clients had nothing to request against. Full
  requests now mint a tracked `resultId`, and the new delta handler returns the
  minimal edit set between a client's cached prior result and the current
  tokens (falling back to a full response when the prior result is unknown).
  (#1917)
- **Named-function-call semantic token class.** Bareword calls (`name(...)`)
  now participate in the same live-verified semantic-token cutover as
  sub/package/method/variable names, continuing the token-accuracy series.
  (#2609)
- **Native class fields (Perl 5.38+) extracted into symbols.** Fields declared
  with the native `field` keyword are now indexed and appear in document/
  workspace symbols and hover, alongside existing Moo/Moose `has` attributes.
  (#3218)
- **Perl 5.44 named-parameter signature help.** Signature help now models
  Perl 5.44 named/optional/slurpy subroutine parameters and the `//=`/`||=`
  named-parameter default operators, instead of treating them as positional.
  (#3331, #3352, #3354)
- **Completions route indirect-object calls through method completion.**
  `new Foo::Bar->` -style indirect-object call sites now offer the same method
  completions as `Foo::Bar->new->`. (#1914)
- **Declared-but-unindexed CPAN dependencies surface as advisory hover/
  completion text.** The server now statically extracts declared dependency
  facts from `cpanfile`, `Makefile.PL`, `Build.PL`, `dist.ini`, `META.json`,
  and `META.yml`, and when a module is declared but not indexed (not yet
  installed/vendored), hover and completion mention it instead of treating it
  as fully unknown. Per-folder config reload now also clears stale
  metadata-derived state instead of leaking it across reloads. (#3137, #3170,
  #3171)
- **`perl-dap` external debugger peer seam (ptkdb-ready).** A backend-neutral
  debug model plus a small Content-Length-framed peer protocol let `perl-dap`
  host an external Perl debugger frontend/backend (`Devel::ptkdb` is the first
  partner), reachable via `perl-dap --external-peer HOST:PORT` or a VS Code
  launch config's `externalPeer`. The native `DebugAdapter`/`DapServer` path is
  unchanged; this first cut wires a live, drivable **mirror-mode** listen
  session (proven with fake-peer tests), with real end-to-end `ptkdb` sessions
  deferred. (#3321, #3404)
- **Native analyzer/formatter/debugger stack is now the only shipped default.**
  `perl.runCritic` defaults to the native critic analyzer even when
  `perlcritic` happens to be on `PATH` (external only when explicitly
  configured); native-engine critic code actions carry native diagnostic
  identity (`perl-lsp-critic` / `native.*` codes) instead of the external
  tool's brand; the shipped `perl-dap` CLI no longer exposes `--bridge`
  (`Perl::LanguageServer`/`Devel::TSPerlDAP` bridging remains a library-only
  conformance reference, never a shipped path); and release archives now fail
  validation if they bundle external Perl tooling or legacy bridge payloads.
  (#3277, #3279, #3282, #3348)

### Fixed

#### LSP integration

- **"Find All References" no longer silently degrades for its default request
  shape.** VS Code's default `includeDeclaration: true` request bailed out of
  the high-fidelity source-backed references tier entirely, falling through to
  the lower-fidelity workspace-index tier on every "Find All References" call.
  (#3050)
- **Stale post-edit index answers are guarded against.** Providers now wait on
  index readiness instead of racing a just-applied edit. (#3149)
- **Package rename fails closed on a partial index** instead of silently
  applying an incomplete rename. (#3176)
- **`callHierarchy/incomingCalls` returns top-level and script callers**
  instead of omitting call sites outside a named sub. (#3191)
- **Cross-construct sub resolution** now covers anonymous subs, typeglobs, and
  `use constant`-declared subs. (#3199)
- **Dynamic typeglob dereferences (`*{...}`) emit a `DynamicBoundary` fact**
  instead of being reported as a literal symbol. (#3209)
- **Completion keeps resolved imports when an export tag is unresolvable**
  instead of dropping the whole import. (#3213)
- **Same-package `our` redeclaration is flagged.** (#3217)
- **`ModuleNotFound` diagnostics use a boundary-aware `.pm` match** instead of
  a substring match that could misclassify unrelated paths. (#3221)
- **The outbound notification queue is bounded**, closing a DoS vector where
  an unbounded queue could grow without limit. (#3223)
- **`documentSymbol` `selectionRange` covers just the name**, not the whole
  declaration. (#3226)
- **Lexical `my`/`state` declarations are excluded from the bare-name unused
  check**, removing false-positive "unused" warnings. (#3227)
- **Malformed pull-diagnostic requests return `InvalidParams`** instead of a
  generic error. (#3229)
- **Completion adds regex-match array special variables** (`@-`/`@+` family)
  to the special-variable set. (#3255)
- **`eval`-scoped sub suppression for PL109 is now order-aware**, closing a
  false-negative where sub order affected suppression. (#3286)
- **Bare-block package context is scoped to the block** instead of leaking
  into sibling scopes. (#3353)
- **Clicking the package-prefix of a qualified name no longer navigates to the
  sub** — only the sub-name segment does. (#3360)
- **`typeHierarchy` operations support cancellation.** (#3455)
- **References refuse exact-tier promotion across dynamic boundaries**,
  avoiding a false-precision result where the reference set can't actually be
  proven exact. (#3461)
- **Hover and references guards restored** after a regression reintroduced the
  gap they closed. (#3466)
- **The PIR-A lexical references slice is promoted**, raising fidelity for
  lexical-variable "Find All References". (#3478)
- **`textDocument/typeDefinition` and `/implementation` fallback is pinned to
  the document generation captured at request time**, preventing a
  stale-vs-fresh mismatch mid-edit. (#3622)
- **Completion emits its analyze span on cancellation** instead of dropping
  timing data for cancelled requests. (#3623)
- **Hover documents `@+`, `@-`, `@EXPORT`, `@EXPORT_OK`, `%!`, and
  `%EXPORT_TAGS`** special variables, which previously returned no
  documentation. (#1866)
- **`DESTROY`/`AUTOLOAD` are recognized as special method hooks**, not
  ordinary `UNIVERSAL` methods, in hover and navigation. (#1836)
- **`positionEncoding` negotiation honors the client's preference list**
  instead of ignoring it. (#1856)
- **Document symbols nested under an offset-0 package are deduplicated.**
  (#1583)
- **Folding ranges are deduplicated**, and a region-start-line assertion
  corrected. (#3168)
- **Rename ignores non-code package text during scope lookup.** (#3112)
- **Rename validates keywords by context** — `$if`/`@while` are allowed as
  variable names, while `sub if` is still rejected. (#3109)
- **The workspace reference index no longer silently drops references inside
  block-form `package Foo { ... }`/`class Foo { ... }` bodies, typeglob
  aliasing, `goto &coderef`, regex-bind expressions (`=~`), `tie` argument
  lists, indirect-object call arguments, subroutine signature default
  values, and non-variable assignment/increment targets** — "Find All
  References", rename, and `workspace/symbol` now see these previously
  unindexed reference sites. Consolidating the workspace indexer's two
  independent reference walks into one traversal closed these
  pre-existing coverage gaps as a side effect. (#1711)

#### Debugger (DAP)

- **Breakpoint line-adjustment messages are preserved when the breakpoint
  condition is invalid**, instead of being dropped. (#3216)
- **Breakpoint file matching requires a path boundary**, preventing an
  unrelated file with a matching suffix from being treated as the same file.
  (#3225)
- **Process/thread ID casts saturate instead of silently truncating.** (#3233)
- **Launch remediation guidance points at the configured `perlPath`.** (#3245)
- **`DebugAdapter` implements `Drop`**, ensuring session cleanup runs even on
  an unclean shutdown path. (#3247)
- **Stale `Child` `variablesReference`s are short-circuited on a cache miss
  after resume**, instead of serving a reference from before the resume.
  (#3369)

#### Diagnostics

- **PL401 (two-argument `open` security check) fires for the parenthesized
  2-arg form** (`open(FH, ">file")`), which previously slipped through because
  the parser wraps parenthesized call args in a single `ArrayLiteral` node.
  (#3674)
- **PL404 no longer false-positives on sub-local lexicals**, and ties between
  same-offset scopes are now broken deterministically (innermost scope wins)
  instead of depending on hash-iteration order. (#3659, #3705)
- **PL100/PL101's implicit-strict module list corrected** against real Perl
  module behavior — several modules on the "implies `use strict`/`use
  warnings`" allowlist did not actually do so. (#3729)
- **Regexes with nested quantifiers no longer downgrade a document to partial
  semantics.** They're now recorded as an advisory diagnostic (still a warning
  in the editor) rather than a blocking parse error. (#3682, #3698)

#### Parser correctness

- **`goto &sub` frame replacement is distinguished from `goto LABEL` and `goto
  EXPR`.** (#1923)
- **`NodeKind::VString` added** for v-string literals, distinguishing them
  from other string forms. (#1871)
- **Incomplete-brace recovery marks the error explicitly** instead of masking
  it. (#1906)
- **A reversed `HashLiteral` span is fixed** by capturing the closing `}`
  token directly. (#3364)
- **Parenthesized `try` calls are disambiguated** from the `try`/`catch`
  statement form. (#3572)
- **`${name}` parses as a scalar variable**, not a symbolic dereference.
  (#3590)
- **Unparenthesized declaration lists are supported** (e.g. `my $a, $b`
  parses as a declaration list). (#3627)
- **Heredoc body offsets are tracked**, fixing downstream position mapping for
  heredoc content. (#3650)
- **Unparenthesized `my`/`our`/`state` declares only the first variable**,
  matching real Perl semantics instead of treating the remaining
  comma-separated names as part of the declaration. (#3738)
- **Encoding-aware file reading is consolidated**, fixing a crash on Latin-1
  and UTF-16 Perl source files. (#3054)
- **`line_index` overflow/panic sites hardened** against out-of-range offsets.
  (#3042)
- **Mid-surrogate UTF-16 columns are clamped** in `position_to_offset` instead
  of panicking. (#3040)
- **AST traversal recursion depth is bounded**, preventing a stack overflow on
  deeply nested or adversarial input. (#3207)

### Performance

- **Editor responsiveness: `didChange` returns before parsing completes.**
  Moved full parsing and parent-map construction out of the
  `textDocument/didChange` critical path and onto a bounded, latest-only
  background worker. Stale parses and parse-derived effects remain
  generation-gated. In the 78 KB, 20-edit Neovim receipt, maximum
  `didChange` handler time fell from about 269 ms to 1.6 ms. (#3618, Fresh
  Facts Fast program #3396)
- **Type inference is cached per document.** Hover and completion previously
  rebuilt the type-inference engine on every request for an unchanged
  document; it's now cached by URI and content hash and invalidated on
  `didChange`/`didClose`. (#3254)
- **`workspace/symbol` lookup is indexed** instead of an O(n) scan over every
  file's symbols on every query. (#3211)
- **Workspace-symbol search exits early once the result cap is reached**,
  instead of collecting and cloning every match before truncating. (#3228)

### Security

- **`anyhow` updated** to resolve RUSTSEC-2026-0190. (#3195)
- **Heredoc anti-pattern detector regexes bounded to a single line**, closing
  a ReDoS vector where an unclosed heredoc delimiter in a large document could
  trigger catastrophic backtracking. (#3568)

## [0.17.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- **DAP debug sessions use the same Perl interpreter as LSP analysis.** When a
  `launch.json` configuration omits an explicit `perl`, the debugger now
  resolves the interpreter through the shared toolchain profile
  (perlbrew → plenv → `PATH`) instead of ignoring the active toolchain and
  defaulting to a bare `"perl"`. An explicit `launch.json` `perl` is still
  honored verbatim, and resolution falls back to `"perl"` when nothing is found
  so the existing "perl not on PATH" diagnostic is preserved. Completes the
  unified executable-profile work that also centralized interpreter resolution
  and cached version probing across LSP and DAP. (#1929)
- **Automatic `.perltidyrc` discovery at the workspace root.** When no
  `perltidy_profile` is explicitly configured, the server now discovers a
  project-local `.perltidyrc` once during `initialize` — searching the
  workspace root, then perltidy's documented `PERLTIDY` environment override,
  then `$HOME/.perltidyrc` — and uses it when building the formatter config.
  Explicit configuration always takes precedence. (#1899, issue #1777)
- **Default native formatter honors the discovered `.perltidyrc`.** The
  supported scalar options in a discovered profile (line width, indent, tabs,
  brace/else placement, keyword spacing, trailing commas) are parsed at
  `initialize` and applied to the server config as a layer between the built-in
  defaults and user configuration, so project formatting applies in the default
  native engine — not just `external-legacy` mode. Precedence: built-in
  defaults < discovered profile < `.perl-lsp.toml` / `didChangeConfiguration`,
  so an explicitly configured field still wins. (#2016, #2025, issue #1953)
- **First-run doctor report.** `perllsp --doctor [dir]` now prints a read-only
  workspace setup report covering project config, Perl interpreter probing,
  configured include roots, `PERL5LIB`, system `@INC`, rejected roots, and the
  effective include-root categories the server will use. Failed Perl version
  probes preserve stderr guidance for actionable setup fixes. (#1571, issue #1818)
- **Shared Perl toolchain profile.** LSP, DAP, and first-run diagnostics now
  resolve Perl interpreter identity through a common `PerlToolchainProfile`,
  with cached version probes for fingerprinted binaries and deterministic
  handling for bare `PATH` commands. (#1951, #1978, issue #1929)
- **Workspace method signature help for `->method()` calls.** Triggering
  signature help (or hovering) on an OO method call now resolves the signature
  from the workspace symbol index for methods defined in the same project,
  rather than returning nothing. (#1301)
- **`our` variables in document and workspace symbols.** Package-scoped
  variables declared with `our` are now included in the symbol index and
  therefore visible in editor outline and go-to-symbol lookups. (#1300)
- **Moo/Moose `has` attributes in document and workspace symbols.** Object
  attributes declared with `has` (Moo, Moose, Moo::Role, Moose::Role) are now
  indexed and appear in outline and symbol search. (#1300)
- **Phase-block hover docs (`BEGIN`/`END`/`INIT`/`CHECK`/`UNITCHECK`).** Hovering
  over a Perl phase block now displays an explanation of when that block runs
  relative to compile and runtime. (#1298)
- **Framework-aware deterministic inline completions.** Try::Tiny `try`/`catch`
  scaffolds, Mojolicious::Lite and Dancer route scaffolds, and project-indexed
  package receiver method completions are now offered only when the workspace
  evidence supports them. (#1532, #1573, #1585, #1949, issue #1648)
- **DAP logpoint interpolation substrate.** Breakpoint hit registration can now
  interpolate supplied scalar variables in logpoint message templates while
  preserving existing raw-message behavior when no variable map is available.
  (#1807)
- **VS Code first-run onboarding helpers.** The extension can suggest discovered
  include paths from common Perl module directories, exposes an optional
  server-gated AI completion walkthrough/prompt, and ships an openable demo
  project for new installations. (#1898)

### Fixed

#### Debugger (DAP)

- **Stale stack frames cleared on resume.** When the debugger resumes and hits
  the next stop, the call stack and variables views now reflect the new stop
  position instead of the previous one. (#1337)
- **Degraded-transport `stackTrace` returns empty, not stale.** When the debug
  transport is in a degraded state, `stackTrace` returns an empty frame list
  rather than serving a stale snapshot from an earlier stop. (#1337)
- **Structured/container evaluate results expand in the variables view.**
  Evaluating an expression that returns a hash, array, or blessed reference now
  allocates a proper `variablesReference` so the editor can expand the result
  in the watch and variables panel. (#1219)
- **Invalid `variablesReference` returns a safe empty response.** Requests with
  an out-of-range or stale variables reference now return a protocol-safe empty
  response instead of crashing or returning garbage data. (#1227)
- **Execution-control requests with no active session return clear guidance.**
  Sending `continue`, `next`, `stepIn`, or similar when no debug session is
  active now returns an actionable error message instead of silently reporting
  success. (#1240)
- **`pause` accurately distinguishes signal-delivery failure from no-session.**
  `pause` now reports whether the failure was "no active session" or "session
  exists but signal delivery failed", giving editors and users an accurate
  explanation. (#1364)
- **`variablesReference` spaces are separated by type.** Scope, stack, and
  evaluate-result references now use a typed codec, retiring the collision class
  where one reference kind could be decoded as another. (#1430, #1444)
- **`evaluate` validates the expression before frame lookup.** Empty or unsafe
  expressions now report the expression problem even when the frame id is bad,
  avoiding misleading no-session errors. (#1496)
- **Malformed debugger stack contexts reject blank file names.** Stack parsing
  no longer accepts whitespace-only file fields as a real frame location.
  (#1498)
- **DAP request ordering fails with explicit protocol errors.** `launch` now
  requires a prior `initialize`, and `configurationDone` now requires an
  active launch or attach session instead of accepting out-of-sequence clients.
  (#1806)
- **DAP scopes expose pagination hint fields.** Scope responses now carry the
  optional `namedVariables` and `indexedVariables` fields from the DAP
  specification, preserving compatibility when counts are unavailable. (#1810)
- **DAP variables responses expose `totalVariables` when known.** Debug clients
  can now show accurate variables pagination counts without changing existing
  responses where a count is unavailable. (#1811)
- **DAP capability flags match implemented handlers.** The initialize response
  now advertises restart frame, step-in targets, and terminate-threads support
  when those routed handlers exist, so clients can discover the implemented
  operations. (#1759)
- **DAP transport handles non-request messages explicitly.** Client-originated
  Response and Event messages are now accepted and logged without producing
  spurious stdout or disrupting normal request handling. (#1790, issue #1608)
- **DAP event writes fail closed after persistent transport failure.** The event
  handler now detects repeated write/flush failures, marks the transport broken,
  and lets the main loop shut down cleanly instead of silently losing events or
  hanging on a broken socket. (#1809, issue #1609)

#### Editor settings

- **`enableSemanticTokens` and `enableFormatting` settings now take effect.**
  These settings were previously wired up but had no runtime effect; the
  underlying providers now check and honor them. Two no-op settings
  (`enableDiagnostics`, `enableRefactoring`) that appeared in configuration UIs
  but never did anything have been removed. (#1290)

#### LSP integration

- **Bare absolute file paths accepted as `file://` URIs.** Editors or scripts
  that send an absolute path (e.g. `/home/user/foo.pl`) instead of a proper
  `file:///home/user/foo.pl` URI no longer get a silent failure; the server now
  accepts both forms. (#1206)
- **Actionable error on malformed `signatureHelp` requests.** A request with a
  wrong shape now returns a descriptive error message rather than a generic
  protocol error. (#1206)
- **"Document not open" semantic-token errors explain the `didOpen` sequencing.**
  Editors that request semantic tokens before sending `textDocument/didOpen` now
  receive a message explaining the required sequencing, rather than a bare error
  code. (#1206)
- **Baseline single-root LSP smoke blockers repaired.** The runtime and tests
  now preserve hover state, wait for workspace file-operation indexing, handle
  empty workspace-folder inputs as no-ops, and keep progress harness output
  deterministic. (#1551)
- **Multi-root `workspace/symbol` is deterministic.** Workspace-symbol queries
  now wait briefly for active indexing, preserve each symbol's workspace-folder
  URI, and return repeatable results across roots. (#1522)
- **Workspace indexing counters stay truthful after duplicate parse-complete
  signals.** Pending parse metrics now saturate at zero instead of wrapping to
  `usize::MAX`, so first-open indexing/degraded status cannot report a
  permanent parse storm from out-of-order lifecycle notifications. (#2606,
  issue #2553)
- **Reference fallback avoids document-lock re-entry.** Partial-index reference
  fallback no longer re-enters the documents lock while searching open files.
  (#1597)
- **PL701 missing-module suggestions point at setup guidance.** Missing-module
  diagnostics now append `perllsp --doctor <workspace>` and the PL701 docs URL
  to legacy and context-aware suggestion text while preserving branch-specific
  `includePaths`, `useSystemInc`, `resolutionTimeout`, and `cpanm` hints.
  (#2047, issue #2049)
- **Perl documentation links share one validated target resolver.** Hover,
  document-link, resolve, and virtual perldoc surfaces now build MetaCPAN,
  `perldoc://`, and perldoc.perl.org targets through the same resolver, and
  malformed module payloads are rejected instead of turned into bad URLs.
  (#1638)
- **POD `L<>` references are clickable document links.** `textDocument/documentLink`
  now exposes module/core-pragma and same-document POD section references from
  real POD blocks, and `documentLink/resolve` validates same-document section
  fragments before returning `#section` targets. (#1795)
- **Non-standard POD sections are indexed for documentation surfaces.** Common
  `=head1` sections such as `ARGUMENTS`, `RETURN VALUES`, `EXAMPLES`, and
  `SEE ALSO` are now extracted instead of being dropped from POD-derived
  documentation. (#1834, issue #1610)
- **POD hover refreshes after external module edits.** Hover documentation
  cached from a resolved module file is refreshed when that file's mtime
  changes outside the LSP document lifecycle, so hover no longer serves stale
  POD after on-disk edits. (#1882)
- **Hover documentation escapes markdown metacharacters.** Documentation text
  containing characters such as `*`, `_`, `#`, and `[]` now renders literally
  in hover cards instead of becoming unintended markdown formatting. (#1840)
- **Context-specific completions keep semantic groups together.** Hash-key,
  Moo/Moose type and option, and Object::Pad constructor-parameter completions
  now use separate sort tiers so clients do not interleave unrelated suggestions
  alphabetically. (#1875)
- **Completion items send `filterText` to clients.** Completion responses now
  serialize the internally-computed `filterText` field, preserving expected
  client-side matching for snippets and other items whose label differs from
  the typed prefix. (#1889)
- **Completion capabilities advertise insert text modes.** Initialize responses
  now advertise `completionProvider.completionItem.insertTextModes: [1, 2]`
  for LSP 3.17 clients when completion is enabled, matching the server's
  PlainText and Snippet insertion support. (#1838, issue #1712)
- **Package-qualified method completions include inherited methods.** Completion
  for package receivers now considers inherited methods in the workspace model
  instead of limiting suggestions to methods declared directly on the receiver.
  (#1841)
- **Completions stay quiet in strings and non-code regions.** General variable,
  function, and method completions are suppressed inside ordinary strings, regex
  patterns, heredoc bodies, and POD, while path completions and intentional
  quoted module/import contexts remain available. Heredoc left-shift detection
  now keeps arrow-method and constant-shift Perl contexts from being mistaken
  for heredoc bodies. (#1808, #1813, #1821, #2573)
- **Multiline inline completions are parse-checked against the full document.**
  Inline completion candidates whose replacement ranges span lines now run
  full-document parse probes and fail closed when a range cannot be
  reconstructed, preventing syntactically damaging ghost text from being shown.
  (#1926)
- **Duplicate quick-fix code actions are collapsed.** When overlapping
  providers produce byte-identical lightbulb entries, the server now keeps one
  action and builds `source.fixAll` from the deduplicated set. (#1913)

#### Formatting

- **Range formatting works when complex syntax exists elsewhere in the file.**
  Formatting a selected range no longer fails when the rest of the file contains
  regex literals, heredocs, `qw(...)`, or POD blocks outside the selection.
  (#1314)
- **Heredoc and multiline folding boundaries are corrected.** Folding ranges for
  heredocs and multiline constructs now align with the intended source spans.
  (#1560)

#### Rename and refactor

- **Rename correctly updates dereference and string-interpolation occurrences.**
  A workspace rename now covers `$$var`, `@{$var}`, and interpolated `"…$var…"`
  occurrences in addition to bare identifier uses. (#1304)
- **Rename uses character-aware word boundaries.** The boundary check now
  handles multi-byte UTF-8 characters correctly, preventing partial-match
  renames that would corrupt identifiers containing non-ASCII characters. (#1288)
- **Package-scoped rename refuses unsafe fallback edits.** Package renames now
  prefer exact qualified-call edits and empty unsafe fallback plans instead of
  silently applying same-file edits when workspace or index facts are incomplete.
  (#2070, issue #1511)

#### Diagnostics and code actions

- **Code actions no longer panic on mid-codepoint UTF-8 ranges.** Invalid byte
  ranges inside multibyte characters now produce no action instead of slicing
  through a character boundary; valid character-boundary ranges still work.
  (#1481)
- **Arrow-deref hash keys are no longer flagged as strict barewords.**
  `$self->{name}` and `$ref->{key}` are recognized as Perl's auto-quoted hash
  key form while real strict-bareword violations still report. (#1562)
- **Missing `use strict` / `use warnings` diagnostics use Warning severity.**
  PL100 and PL101 now match the diagnostic catalog, so first-open pragma
  guidance is visible at the intended warning level. (#2061, issue #1766)
- **`source.fixAll` deduplicates strict/warnings pragma inserts.** Fix-all now
  keeps one semantic strict insert and one warnings insert, preferring the
  source-aware insertion point instead of producing duplicate pragmas from
  overlapping providers. (#2058, issue #2056)
- **Printf dynamic width and precision specifiers stay quiet.** The format
  checker no longer reports false positives for valid `%*` and `%.*` printf
  forms. (#1868, issue #1637)
- **DBI receiver completions are import-gated.** DBI-style receiver completions
  now stay quiet unless a visible `use DBI` fact supports them. (#1579)
- **Quoted hash keys with special characters appear in completion.** Hash-key
  completion now includes fully quoted fat-comma keys such as `'db-host'`,
  `'api.key'`, and `'api key'` while keeping unquoted keys conservative. (#1839)

#### Parser recovery and legacy syntax

- **Nested variable lists parse comma-separated items.** Declarations such as
  `my ($a, ($b, $c))` now recover the nested list instead of stopping at the
  inner comma. (#1457)
- **Negative keyword barewords before `=>` are treated as strings.** The parser
  no longer reports false errors for valid fat-comma hash keys such as
  `-strict => 1`. (#1460, #1483)
- **Custom sub attributes and method-call-looking string content stay quiet.**
  Common legacy syntax no longer produces false parser errors for custom
  attributes or interpolated strings containing method-call shapes. (#1461,
  #1463)
- **`s///e` substitution replacement text is classified as Perl code.** This
  improves downstream semantic analysis for executable substitution bodies.
  (#1238)
- **`given` blocks accept normal Perl statements.** The parser now handles
  postfix `when`/`default` modifiers and ordinary statements inside `given`
  blocks while preserving the classic `when { ... }` / `default { ... }` forms.
  (#1893)
- **Lexical sub declarations retain their declarator.** `my sub`, `our sub`,
  and `state sub` nodes now carry the declarator so downstream semantic
  analysis can distinguish lexical subroutines from package-scoped `sub`
  declarations. (#1845, issue #1729)

#### Module resolution

- **`qw(...)` import lists with whitespace before the delimiter are parsed.**
  `use Foo qw( Bar Baz )` (with a space before the opening delimiter) now
  correctly extracts `Bar` and `Baz` from the import list for symbol resolution
  and dependency indexing. (#1205, #1203, #1292)

---

### Under the hood (not user-facing)

- **TextMate grammar visual regression tests.** The VS Code extension's static
  syntax highlighting (`syntaxes/perl.tmLanguage.json`) is now locked down by
  scope snapshots under `vscode-extension/test/grammar/`, run via
  `npm run test:grammar` and enforced in the Extension Jest CI job. Any
  unintended change to highlighting surfaces as an explicit per-token diff.
  Closes the long-standing "visual regression testing for UI features" item in
  the E2E test strategy. (#1907, issue #1908)
- **Parser contract index.** Lexer and parser-core paired-delimiter and
  balanced-segment behavior is now covered by a conformance matrix and documented
  in `docs/reference/PARSER_CONTRACTS.md`. (#1319, #1321, #1324)
- **RIPR coverage tool upgraded from 0.5.0 to 0.9.0.** The CI seam-proof gate
  now uses the current RIPR release. (#1329)
- **AST kind inventories are compiler-derived.** `ALL_KIND_NAMES` now derives
  from `NodeKind::VARIANTS`, removing a hand-maintained mirror list that could
  drift from the enum. (#1491)
- **File-local semantic fact IDs include file identity.** Stable semantic IDs
  for anchors, entities, occurrences, and file-scoped edges now include
  `FileId`, preventing identical source in different files from colliding while
  preserving the file-neutral reference-source sentinel. (#1876)
- **File semantic bundle hashes include synthetic facts before hashing.**
  Generated-member and eval-sub synthetic entities/anchors now flow into the
  canonical shard builder before category hashes are computed, and shards carry
  an explicit producer schema version. (#1904)
- **AST child-classification flags match traversal.** `contains_children` now
  agrees with `Node::for_each_child` for every `NodeKind`, with a drift-guard so
  traversal consumers do not silently skip children. (#1891)
- **HIR lowers core control-flow shells.** Branches, loops, control transfers,
  and postfix statement modifiers now lower into PIR-v0-aligned HIR shells with
  source anchors and static shape facts. No LSP provider behavior is cut over by
  this substrate change. (#1902)
- **PIR v0 tooling IR is lowered from HIR.** The compiler substrate now exposes
  a PIR v0 intermediate representation for tooling consumers while preserving
  the no-provider-cutover boundary for this release. (#1900)
- **Compile-state layers are specified and fixture-pinned.** PLSP-SPEC-0030 now
  defines the L0-L6 compile-state stack, determinism obligations, dynamic
  boundaries, and no-provider-cutover claim boundary, with alignment tests.
  (#1895)
- **Semantic snapshot and identity invariants are documented.** The semantic
  model now has release-facing source truth for snapshot shape, identity
  stability, and consumer obligations. (#1599)
- **Provider-decision schema alignment is restored.** `provider_decision.v1`
  now matches its schema/spec model so release evidence is not built from a
  drifted provider-decision shape. (#1910)
- **`our` declaration semantic-token facts are scoped.** Semantic facts for
  package-scoped `our` declarations now carry a scoped fact class, avoiding
  ambiguity for downstream semantic consumers. (#1920, issue #1922)
- **`state` declaration semantic-token facts are scoped.** The output-neutral
  compiler-token cutover now covers the `my` / `our` / `state` lexical
  declaration trio while continuing to fall back to parser/HIR token output for
  unmatched, stale, generated, or low-confidence spans. (#2030, issue #2027)
- **Parser boundary responsibilities are documented.** POD, heredoc-body, and
  `__DATA__` / `__END__` non-executable boundaries now have a consumer contract
  in `PARSER_CONTRACTS.md`, including strict versus lenient detection posture.
  (#1896)
- **LSP transport framing uses checked body-offset arithmetic.**
  `Content-Length` frame parsing now guards the `body_start` offset calculation
  with checked arithmetic and recovers through the existing invalid-length path
  on overflow. (#1793)
- **Coverage and test gates are separated.** Patch coverage now reports
  coverage shortfall/setup/routing failures separately from routed test
  failures, so a latent unrelated routed test belongs to a test-named gate
  rather than the Codecov/Patch-95 verdict. (#1482, #1549, #1576, #1581, #1586)
- **Coverage receipt tests cover closeout helpers.** Allocation-tracker and
  active-goal manifest coverage tests keep the closeout proof paths visible to
  Patch-95 without treating routed test failures as coverage failures.
  (#1950, #2041)
- **Agent lease proof-control-plane coverage is covered.** Agent lease acquire,
  verify, expiry, stale snapshot/head, malformed input, and task-validation
  paths now have focused xtask unit and CLI tests so lease proof infrastructure
  remains visible to Patch-95. (#2045, issue #2043)
- **CPAN corpus ratchet can run a bounded top-50 profile.** The post-merge corpus
  workflow now has a bounded representative mode in addition to the full ratchet;
  release accuracy claims still require the corresponding receipt. (#1520)
- **Semantic snapshot and PackageSubTable oracle rails are available.** The
  corpus/tooling substrate now has a semantic SNAPSHOT stability rail, an
  end-to-end PackageSubTable differential runner slice, and the first HIR-body
  vertical slice for assignment-shaped expressions. These are compiler-foundation
  receipts, not live LSP provider cutovers. (#2569, #2570, #2571)
- **DAP test seed helpers are gated from production artifacts.** Integration
  tests that need debug-adapter seed helpers now opt into the `test-helpers`
  Cargo feature, and the full parser/DAP CI recipe enables that feature
  explicitly. (#2596, issue #1341)
- **DAP conditional-breakpoint behavior has a real debugger receipt.** The
  conditional-breakpoint regression now launches `perl -d` and observes the
  true stop iteration instead of simulating Perl condition semantics in Rust.
  (#1843, issue #1629)
- **Runner disk preflight and failover are explicit.** Self-hosted runner
  routing now treats disk hygiene as a preflight invariant and falls back only
  for disk-preflight failures, without masking real test or gate failures.
  (#1528)
- **Self-hosted CI removes stale workspace `target/` before checkout.** CX43
  and CX53 Rust Small, RIPR, and UB-review jobs now delete the gitignored
  workspace `target/` during pre-checkout ownership cleanup. Real Cargo output
  remains on `/mnt/ci-scratch`, while stale root-owned workspace receipts no
  longer block checkout or `target` creation. (#1886)
- **Hash-key completion regression tests have unique names.** The duplicate
  test identifier that broke `perl-lsp-rs-core` test builds was renamed without
  changing the fixture or assertions. (#1938)
- **Gate-list rendering has CLI contract coverage.** The `cargo xtask gates
  --list` path now has tests for PR-fast tier filtering, explicit gate
  filtering, and actionable unknown-gate errors without executing configured
  gates. (#1939, issue #1942)
- **PR-fast capability snapshots are current.** LSP capability YAML and JSON
  snapshots were regenerated after `insertTextModes` support so PR-fast guards
  verify the current server contract instead of stale expected output. (#2039,
  issue #2042)
- **Test::More and Test2 inline-completion packs have contract fixtures.** The
  completion-pack matrix now covers import-present positives plus no-import,
  comment, string, POD, near-match, and malformed-context quiet paths for the
  Test::More and Test2::V0 assertion packs. (#1945, issue #1943)
- **Corpus gold fixtures avoid invalid Perl syntax.** Two parser gold fixtures
  that were invalid under Perl 5 were corrected so corpus accuracy metrics no
  longer count fixture bugs as parser false negatives. (#1903)
- **Completion regression coverage covers sigil and quoted-key edges.**
  Variable completion now has regression tests for `$`/`@`/`%` sigil filtering,
  and the routed completion coverage pack exercises double-quoted special hash
  keys after the #1839 gate repair. (#1842, #1894)
- **PR summary rendering coverage was raised.** The coverage gate has additional
  tests for PR summary rendering so Patch-95 behavior stays tied to the
  coverage-reporting path. (#1890)
- **Rust toolchain documentation and CI pins match the actual 1.95 floor.**
  Normative onboarding, stability, CI, and template docs now align with
  `Cargo.toml`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, clippy policy, flake pins, and CI
  toolchain selection. (#1932, #1954, #1957)
- **Main fmt drift was repaired before release staging.** The post-refactor fmt
  drift on main was corrected, and `cargo xtask fmt --check` was restored as a
  clean release gate. (#1960, #2038)
- **Workflow privilege analysis fails closed for untrusted event expressions.**
  Jobs with write permissions must prove every event-expression branch is
  anchored to a trusted event. (#1539)
- **Execute-command routed-suite expectations were refreshed to the tightened
  contract.** The stale test setup was corrected without loosening the
  execute-command assertions. (#1530)
- **Docs/assets-only PRs no longer run the full Rust matrix while preserving
  required workflow triggers.** Pull requests that touch only documentation,
  extension media/snippets, or tree-sitter examples skip the expensive Rust CI
  jobs inside the always-triggered CI workflow; mixed code/doc PRs still run
  the full matrix, and workflow-trigger lint stays enforced. (#1688, #1816,
  #1817)
- **Release evidence git recovery works in Windows worktrees.** Coverage
  baseline, native-tooling status, and RIPR evidence tasks now retry git
  `HEAD`/diff discovery with an ancestor-discovered
  `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_WORK_TREE` fallback, so stale-receipt and release-evidence
  packets still emit when bash/WSL git cannot resolve a worktree gitdir.
  (#1833, #1878, #1881)
- **VSIX release verification is storage-safe and restart-safe.** The VS Code
  bundle script now honors `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` when locating the release binary,
  and the extension engine floor is aligned with the checked-in VS Code API
  typings so `npm run verify:marketplace` can package the release candidate
  from an agent worktree. First-run reinstall also no longer races activation
  into stale language-client state. (#1867)
- **Draft PR ripr routing treats skipped routers as neutral.** Draft pull
  requests no longer fail the ripr aggregate solely because the router
  intentionally skipped execution. (#1689)

## [0.16.0] - 2026-06-06

Release notes: [v0.16.0](docs/releases/v0.16.0.md)

Released as a distinct artifact: tag `v0.16.0` at
`b6d9f12b995ad8ad78ca641940bd73e4b1a3c26d`, GitHub Release published
2026-06-06 with 9 assets, and `perllsp` 0.16.0 on crates.io (2026-06-06, not
yanked). See `RELEASE_HISTORY.md` for the canonical release ledger.

> A 2026-07-22 audit incorrectly recorded this version as skipped and rolled
> into 0.17.0. That was retracted on 2026-07-25 after verification against the
> git tag, the GitHub Releases API, and the crates.io registry. The error is
> documented in `RELEASE_HISTORY.md` rather than erased, because it was
> self-reinforcing: it had been written into both this file and the ledger, so
> the repository corroborated its own mistake.

### Added

- **Perldoc / POD virtual documents** — `perldoc://` document links now resolve
  to POD content from the workspace. Labels in `=head2` and `=item` sections are
  linked targets within the virtual document; module links prefer workspace-local
  POD before falling back to external `perldoc`. (`workspace/textDocumentContent`
  extended with labeled-target link generation.) (#1186)
- **LSP 3.18 applyEdit metadata** — `workspace/applyEdit` requests from the
  server now include `metadata` (`label`, `description`, `isRefactoring`) when
  the client advertises support, providing editors with descriptive undo labels
  for server-originated refactors. (#1184)
- **LSP 3.18 receipt locks** — New negative-claim and contract-lock tests verify
  that capability-gated LSP 3.18 fields (`CompletionList.itemDefaults.data`,
  `CompletionList.applyKind`, `CodeActionOptions.documentation`,
  `SnippetTextEdit` workspace edits, `ApplyWorkspaceEditParams.metadata`,
  `textDocument.codeLens.resolveSupport.properties`) are only emitted when the
  client advertises the relevant capability. Accidental emission is now a test
  failure. (#9628)
- **Semantic tokens: label token type** — Perl statement and control labels
  (`LOOP:`, `BLOCK:`) are now classified with a `label` token type. The semantic
  token type count grows from 23 to 24.
- **Quality gate enforce-new-RIPR+** — The transition gate now blocks new RIPR+
  gaps on every PR. Existing gaps are tracked under a burndown exception
  (expires 2026-09-30). New gaps are hard-blocked immediately. (#8197)
- **Product smoke harness** — 30 UX fixture files and a 40-request smoke script
  provide a deterministic release-readiness check. 6 fixtures / 40 requests
  pass at the RC freeze commit.
- **`perl.explainProviderDecision` execute-command** — Returns the structured
  provider decision explanation payload; reports a low-confidence fallback when
  no provider-specific receipt is attached.

### Fixed

- **Inline completion hard reject zones** — The server now returns an empty
  result for positions inside string literals, comments, heredoc bodies, and
  regex literals, preventing spurious suggestions in non-code contexts. (#9631)
- **Inline completion replacement range safety** — Replacement ranges are now
  clamped to the current line and validated against the document length before
  being emitted, preventing out-of-range positions from reaching the client.
  (#9626)
- **Inline completion trigger-kind policy** — Automatic trigger requests receive
  only the single top deterministic candidate; explicit invoked requests keep the
  richer set. This matches the LSP 3.18 `triggerKind` intent. (#9621)
- **Inline completion LSP 3.18 registration** — Static clients receive top-level
  `inlineCompletionProvider`; dynamic-capable clients receive
  `client/registerCapability`; `experimental.inlineCompletionProvider` is never
  emitted.
- **Folding range refresh receipt** — The server correctly handles
  `workspace/foldingRange/refresh` round-trips in the test harness. (#9633)
- **vscode-extension: Perl-missing remediation message** — The extension now
  shows a corrected message when the `perl` executable is not found.

### Documentation

- Updated JetBrains/LSP4IJ setup docs to prefer the upstream LSP4IJ `perl-lsp`
  integration when available.
- Added the semantic inline-completion roadmap (deterministic project-aware
  ghost text as the lane goal; AI optional and gated).

## [0.15.2] - 2026-05-26

Release notes: [v0.15.2](docs/releases/v0.15.2.md)

Crates.io packaging hotfix for the `cargo install` path.

### Fixed

- **`perl-lsp-rs-core` crate now self-contained on crates.io.** `build_catalog.rs`
  is now included in the published package so the crate is self-contained after
  extraction. This fixes the `0.15.1` crates.io install failure for `perllsp`
  and `perl-dap`. (#9613)

### Added

- **Package-content gate for `perl-lsp-rs-core`** — CI now checks the `.crate`
  file list, extracts the archive, and verifies the unpacked crate with
  `cargo check --locked`. (#9613)

## [0.15.1] - 2026-05-26

Release notes: [v0.15.1](docs/releases/v0.15.1.md)

Patch release focused on LSP4IJ inline completion and lean editor-mode hardening.
Includes the Neovim interactive-latency improvements (generation-aware stale-read
cancellation, `--runtime-mode e2e`, `--diagnostic-mode syntax-only`).

### Added

- **Neovim / lean-editor latency rail** — `--runtime-mode e2e` /
  `PERL_LSP_E2E=1` profile: zero diagnostic debounce, syntax-only diagnostics,
  no eager workspace indexing, no file watchers by default.
- **Generation-aware stale-read cancellation** — hover, completion, definition,
  declaration, typeDefinition, implementation, and references are cancelled with
  `RequestCancelled` when the document generation advances between ingress and
  dispatch.
- **`perl.explainProviderDecision` execute-command surface** — returns the
  structured provider decision explanation payload; reports a low-confidence
  fallback when no provider-specific receipt is attached.
- Raw-RPC latency receipts in `perl-lsp-ux-tests::ux_latency_raw_rpc` and a
  Neovim lean smoke script at `scripts/ux/neovim_lean_smoke.sh`.

### Fixed

- **LSP4IJ inline completion registration** — static clients receive top-level
  `inlineCompletionProvider`; dynamic-capable clients receive
  `client/registerCapability`; `experimental.inlineCompletionProvider` is never
  emitted.
- **Lean editor mode watcher gate** — `--file-watchers=false` is now honoured
  during dynamic watcher registration while feature-specific registrations
  (inline completion) remain available.
- **Semantic tokens no longer advertise delta support** until the
  result-id/delta path is implemented.

### Notes

- This release does not implement true incremental AST reuse. Latency
  improvements come from skipping avoidable background work and cancelling
  stale reads earlier.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-05-22

Release notes: [v0.15.0](docs/releases/v0.15.0.md)

Minor release focused on JSON-RPC type safety and fixing the LSP4IJ
file-watcher registration crash. Breaking change in the public
`perl-lsp-rs-core::protocol` API (request/response ID field type) lifts
this to a minor version under 0.x semver.

### Fixed

- **LSP4IJ file-watcher registration crash** - Server no longer emits
  wall-clock millisecond IDs for `client/registerCapability`
  (~1.7e12 overflows i32 in strict clients including LSP4IJ). All
  server-to-client requests now route through a bounded `AtomicI32`
  allocator that emits values in `1..=i32::MAX` and wraps cleanly.
  This unblocks JetBrains users on the LSP4IJ plugin. (#221, #224)

### Added

- **Typed JSON-RPC request IDs** - `JsonRpcId` (strict-shape enum:
  integer | string; rejects null/fractional/object/array at the serde
  boundary) and `ServerRequestId` (positive-i32 newtype with no
  out-of-range constructor) added to `perl-lsp-rs-core::protocol`.
  The type system now makes the file-watcher crash structurally
  impossible to reintroduce. (#221, #224)
- **Strict inbound ID validation** - Invalid request-ID shapes
  (null, fractional, object, array) are rejected at the transport
  boundary instead of producing undefined behavior deep in the
  dispatcher. (#221)
- **LSP4IJ regression test** - File-watcher registration request ID
  asserted to be a bounded integer in `1..=i32::MAX`. Source-guard
  tests pin the fix against `lifecycle/watchers.rs` re-introducing
  wall-clock-derived IDs. (#221)

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** `JsonRpcRequest.id` and `JsonRpcResponse.id` are now
  `Option<JsonRpcId>` instead of `Option<serde_json::Value>`.
  Consumers of the published `perl-lsp-rs-core::protocol` crate must
  use `JsonRpcId::Integer(N)` / `JsonRpcId::String(...)` in tests and
  any external construction. `Value` round-trips via `to_value()` /
  `from_value()`. (#221)
- **BREAKING:** `outbound::OutboundSender::send_request` now takes
  `ServerRequestId` instead of raw `i64`. (#221)
- **Cancellation registry typed end-to-end** - `CancellationRegistry`
  tokens, cleanup contexts, and cache are keyed by `JsonRpcId`
  instead of `format!("{:?}", value)` strings.
  `PerlLspCancellationToken.request_id`,
  `RequestCleanupGuard.request_id`, `cancel_mark` / `is_cancelled` /
  `register_progress_request`, and the runtime `cancelled` /
  `progress_token_to_request` collections all move from `Value` to
  `JsonRpcId`. Integer and string IDs with the same textual form
  (e.g. `7` vs `"7"`) are now independently cancellable. (#223, #224)
- **`pending_workspace_configuration_requests`** is now keyed by
  `ServerRequestId` rather than raw `i64`. (#221)

### Looking ahead

- LSP interactive latency rollout rail at
  [`docs/development/LSP_INTERACTIVE_LATENCY_ROLLOUT.md`](docs/development/LSP_INTERACTIVE_LATENCY_ROLLOUT.md).
  Workload-profile and stale-work-cancellation work that benefits
  Neovim and LSP4IJ equally; targets 0.15.1. Umbrella tracking: **#229**.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-05-12

Release notes: [v0.14.0](docs/releases/v0.14.0.md)

> **Release boundary correction.** No `v0.13.4` tag was cut. The previous
> actual tag is `v0.13.3`, so the valid cumulative comparison is
> [`v0.13.3...v0.14.0`](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/compare/v0.13.3...v0.14.0).
> That range includes the source state prepared while the workspace carried
> version `0.13.4`; it is not a narrow 0.14-only logical ledger.
>
> <!-- lineage-correction:0.13 -->

### Added

- **Rust 1.95 MSRV** — Minimum supported Rust version raised to 1.95.
  Consumers must use `rustup update stable` (Rust 1.95+ ships stable).
- **Runtime-owned TTL completion cache** — Prefix module scan results are
  now cached with a bounded TTL, eliminating redundant lookups across
  successive completion requests. (#8514 → PR #8667)
- **Literal `require`/`use` symbol tracking** — Symbols from `require
  'Module.pm'` and explicit `use Module` imports are now tracked and offered
  in completions. (#8623 → PR #8678)
- **Real-workspace provider baseline** — Integration tests against a real
  Perl project fixture give confidence that LSP providers work beyond
  synthetic test data. (#8637 → PRs #8682, #8694)
- **DAP module-resolution smoke tests** — Catches regressions in debug
  adapter module loading before they ship. (#8621 → PR #8677)
- **PerlOracleEnv v1 subprocess contract** — Replaces ambient
  `$ENV{PERL5LIB}` injection with an explicit typed contract; subprocess
  environment is now auditable. (#8622 → PRs #8675, #8679)
- **Non-Rust file policy advisory checker** — `cargo xtask check-file-policy
  --mode advisory` documents non-Rust file ownership with an enforced
  allowlist, removing a class of accidental scope drift. (#8566 → PR #8708;
  #8568 → PR #8711)
- **PR sticky CI summary and `ci-doctor`** — `cargo xtask ci-doctor` gives
  clear in-PR feedback without reading raw CI logs. (#4825 → PR #8697;
  #4826 → PR #8693)
- **PR title validation** — `cargo xtask pr title-check` catches malformed
  PR titles before CI. (#8614 → PR #8700)
- **Freshness-check xtask** — Prevents stale-binary false passes locally.
  (#8619 → PR #8683)

### Changed

- **Clippy temporary-allow burndown** — 4 of 5 workspace-level
  `#[allow(clippy::...)]` suppression annotations removed. Only
  `collapsible_match` remains, tracked in #8561. (PR #8712)
- **Clippy lint policy MSRV reconcile** — Clippy lint set aligned with
  actual Rust 1.95 availability. (PR #8707)

### Infrastructure

- All deferred items have verified-open successor issues — nothing dropped,
  everything tracked. See `docs/releases/0.14.0-readiness.md` for the full
  queue.

## [0.13.4] - 2026-05-07

Release notes: [0.13.4 prepared milestone](docs/releases/v0.13.4.md)

> **Prepared milestone, not a tagged release.** The repository has no
> `v0.13.4` ref. This section records changes staged while the workspace carried
> version `0.13.4`; those changes first appear in the later tagged `v0.14.0`
> tree. Do not infer a standalone asset, package, or compare boundary from this
> heading.

### Fixed

- **Known session-creep leaks across LSP caches** — Hover, text-sync,
  workspace, stream-session, and workspace-index caches were retaining
  per-session state past document close/delete lifecycle paths. Eviction is
  now wired through, and retained-state regression tests lock the behavior.
  (#8064)
- **Stream sessions cancel across URI variants** — Stale inline-completion
  stream sessions on `didChange` are cancelled even when the client mixes
  canonical `file://` and `file://localhost` spellings for the same
  document. Regression covers both spellings.
- **Regex embedded code annotated, not rejected** — The parser now
  annotates embedded code inside regex constructs instead of failing the
  parse. (#8056)
- **Status pipeline regeneration** — Parser-accuracy artifact is now
  bootstrapped before regeneration (#8069) and quality counts are parsed
  from external target dirs (#8068), so `docs/project/status/*.md`
  reflects reality after out-of-tree CI runs.
- **Stricter VS Code extension lint** — Cleared lint failures from the
  upgraded TypeScript and `@types/vscode` toolchain. (#8065)

### Added

- **Class::Tiny and Class::Tiny::RW OO framework support** — Full
  semantic analysis for the Class::Tiny family across both the
  `ClassModelBuilder` and `SymbolExtractor` pipelines. `use Class::Tiny
  qw(name email)` and bare `has 'name';` declarations now produce
  accessor symbols so go-to-definition, hover, and workspace symbol
  search work for Class::Tiny accessors. (#8062)
- **LSP churn plateau guardrails** — New `memory_plateau.json` receipt,
  nightly + PR CI gates, `scripts/repro_lsp_storm.py` reproducer, and
  `scripts/assert_rss_plateau.py` plateau assertion. Documented in
  `docs/large-workspaces/LSP_CHURN_REPRO.md` and a new
  `RETAINED_STATE_INVENTORY.md` cataloguing every retained cache, its
  owner, and its eviction rule. Runtime pressure counters expose async
  task/debounce/session pressure, and diagnostics churn now has direct
  retained-state coverage. (#8072, #8076, #8088, #8115)
- **Memory-control closeout** — Long-session retained-state memory behavior
  is now covered by lifecycle cleanup, runtime pressure counters, plateau
  receipts, trend rendering, focused subsystem regressions, and
  retained-state inventory policy. This closes the known retained-state /
  session-creep class and adds guardrails against recurrence, without
  claiming every possible memory issue is fixed. See
  [MEMORY_CONTROL_CLOSEOUT.md](docs/large-workspaces/MEMORY_CONTROL_CLOSEOUT.md).
- **Governed clippy lint policy gate** — New CI gate enforcing the
  `policy/clippy-lints.toml` allowlist. (#8066)
- **Parser coverage risk map and baseline.** (#8005)

### Changed

- **MSRV bumped to Rust 1.93.1** — Toolchain pins, CI matrix, clippy
  policy, `clippy.toml`, and `rust-toolchain.toml` aligned. (#7832)
- **Decoupled `perl-semantic-analyzer` from `perl-workspace`** —
  Removed direct coupling; analyzer no longer reaches into workspace
  internals. (#7962)
- **Internal refactor wave (non-user-visible)** — Hover receiver
  package resolver extracted (#8045); execute-command test-runner
  fallback split into helpers (#8046); completion provider
  construction helpers extracted (#8044); call-hierarchy subroutine
  item builder extracted (#8043); refactor-plan contract skeleton
  added to `perl-refactoring` (#7983).
- **Centralized VS Marketplace install badge count.** (#8049)
- **Dependency bumps** — `actions/upload-artifact` 4 → 7 (#7914),
  `actions/checkout` 4 → 6 (#7915), `actions/cache` 4 → 5 (#7916),
  `@types/vscode` (#7912), TypeScript group (#7911).
- Prepared the `v0.13.4` public-alpha patch train with workspace, crate,
  feature catalog, and VS Code extension version surfaces aligned.

## [0.13.3] - 2026-05-03

Release notes: [v0.13.3](docs/releases/v0.13.3.md)

### Fixed

- **VS Code managed binary install reliability** — Reinstall now installs
  into a versioned subdirectory and atomically updates a `current` pointer,
  so a forced reinstall while the previous `perllsp.exe` is held by a
  running process lands in a fresh sibling directory instead of failing
  with `EBUSY`.
- **Lifecycle-safe `Perl: Reinstall Server Binary`** — The command stops a
  running language client before installing, restarts with the newly
  installed binary on success, and falls back to the previous binary on
  download or health-check failure so a failed reinstall never leaves the
  user worse off than before.
- **Extended retry budget for transient managed-install file locks** —
  Total retry wait grows from ~4s to ~31s, covering the upper end of
  Windows Defender first-time signature scans on a fresh release artifact.
- **Singleflight managed install** — Activation auto-download, manual
  Reinstall, and the silent update check coalesce so two installs cannot
  race the same destination path.

### Changed

- Strengthened source and published VS Code smokes to reinstall twice
  across Windows, macOS, and Linux, with the binary held by a spawned
  process during the second pass. Smokes upload artifacts under
  `target/receipts/vscode-smoke/<source>/<os>/` on every run.
- Prepared the `v0.13.3` public-alpha patch train with workspace, crate,
  feature catalog, and VS Code extension version surfaces aligned.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-05-02

Release notes: [v0.13.2](docs/releases/v0.13.2.md)

### Changed

- Prepared the `v0.13.2` public-alpha patch train with workspace, crate,
  feature catalog, and VS Code extension version surfaces aligned.
- Made release closeout focus on the real user install surfaces: Homebrew tap,
  GitHub release assets, VS Code Marketplace, and Open VSX.
- Aligned parser scorecard truth semantics for clean-ingestion, salvage, and
  insufficient-data rows.

### Fixed

- Locked Homebrew tap, GNU/musl binary selection, installer target selection,
  and VS Code managed-binary startup paths behind release hygiene checks.
- Added release-note chooser and install-surface checks to keep future
  public-alpha release notes from drifting back to stale install guidance.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-05-01

Release notes: [v0.13.1](docs/releases/v0.13.1.md)

> **Release boundary correction.** No final `v0.13.0` tag was cut. The release
> line moved directly from `v0.13.0-rc1` to `v0.13.1`; use
> [`v0.13.0-rc1...v0.13.1`](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/compare/v0.13.0-rc1...v0.13.1)
> for source comparison.

### Changed

- Hardened public-alpha release channels after the `v0.13.0-rc1` rehearsal.
- Decoupled Open VSX publishing from VS Code Marketplace publishing.
- Clarified release naming: package versions use normal SemVer while product
  posture remains public alpha.
- Improved CI Gate timeout headroom and diagnostics for release runs.
- Corrected Homebrew/tap naming and formula generation around the `perllsp`
  binary.

## [0.13.0-rc1] - 2026-04-30

Release notes: [v0.13.0-rc1](docs/releases/v0.13.0-rc1.md)

> **Historical outcome.** This remained the only `0.13.0` tag. No final
> `v0.13.0` source boundary was created; the next tagged release was
> `v0.13.1` on May 1, 2026.

### Fixed

- **CI cancellation cascade fix — label events no longer cancel active runs** —
  `cancel-in-progress` now scopes to `pull_request.synchronize` only, so applying
  labels (e.g. `merge-ready`, `ci-green`) does not abort an in-flight CI run on
  the same PR. Adds a `LABEL_EVENT_CANCELS_PR_RUN` xtask lint to prevent the
  failure mode from re-entering. Resolves a recurring queue-blocker that
  surfaced as `exit 143` SIGTERM aborts on PR Smoke and CI Gate. (#7581)

- **First-run error messaging now surfaces to users instead of silent logging** — When
  workspace root is not detected (e.g., opening a single file without opening a folder),
  perl-lsp now sends a `window/showMessage` notification with actionable guidance:
  "perl-lsp: workspace root not detected — module resolution disabled. To enable: open
  the project folder in your editor (File > Open Folder) rather than individual files.
  This warning appears once per server session." Previously this was logged to the server
  log only and users saw nothing. The warning flag is stored as an `Arc<AtomicBool>` on
  `LspServer`, so each server session shows the warning independently — in multi-root or
  multi-server workspace configurations, each `LspServer` instance tracks its own shown
  state rather than sharing a process-level `Once`. (#4178)

### Migration

- **Microcrate collapse complete — migration guide available** — The 0.13.0-rc1/0.13
  train drops the
  published crate count from 132 to 32 across 10+ collapse waves. All ~100 retired
  crate names stop appearing on crates.io after this release; their code lives as
  subfolder modules inside the owning published crate. See
  [`docs/MIGRATION_v0.13.md`](docs/MIGRATION_v0.13.md) for the complete
  old-path → new-path mapping for every retired crate, feature flag changes
  (`lsp-ga-lock`, `incremental`, `workspace_refactor`), and the breaking-changes
  summary per wave. (#7292, #4410)

### Internal

- **Release prep: start `v0.13.0-rc1` version staging** — bumped workspace and internal crate dependency versions to `0.13.0-rc1`, updated the feature catalog metadata version, and refreshed the top-level README release line for release-candidate signaling. (#0000)

- **`cargo xtask published-crate-count`** — new ratchet gate that monitors the
  count of entries in `[workspace.metadata.publish.allow]` and prevents accidental
  regression during the microcrate collapse (ADR-0041). Fails if the count exceeds
  the baseline in `xtask/published-crate-baseline.txt`; auto-tightens the baseline
  when count decreases. Run via `just ci-published-crate-count` or directly as
  `cargo xtask published-crate-count`. (#4416)

## [0.12.4] - 2026-04-12

Release notes: [v0.12.4](docs/releases/v0.12.4.md) · [GitHub Release](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/releases/tag/v0.12.4)

<!-- 2026-04-11 session: 46 PRs merged across navigation, pragma scoping, incremental parsing, workspace refactoring, Windows hardening, and CI hygiene -->
<!-- 2026-04-12 session: ~25 PRs merged — DAP scorecard, rename perf, editor UX, diagnostics polish, hover improvements, workspace/config, completion ranking, Windows compat, CI hygiene -->

### Headlines

- **Inherited and role method navigation now works end-to-end** — `goto-definition`,
  hover, and workspace completion all BFS through Moo/Moose `with 'Role'` and
  `extends`/`use parent` chains. Previously only direct-method navigation worked;
  inherited methods from parent classes or composed roles returned nothing.
  AUTOLOAD-backed method calls also resolve through the fallback path, and hover
  surfaces the AUTOLOAD resolution. (#4077, #4091)

- **Pragma tracker correctness sweep** — four independent false-negative paths
  in `PragmaTracker` / `check_strict_warnings` fixed in one wave:
  - eval- and sub-scoped `use strict`/`use warnings` no longer suppress
    file-level PL100/PL101 diagnostics; `state_for_offset` is now the single
    source of truth for top-level pragma state (#4052)
  - conditional `use if` / `use unless` pragmas are tracked via suffix
    matching on the flattened argument list (#4050)
  - explicit `use feature` / `no feature` state (including `qw(...)` and
    `:X.Y` version bundles) drives lint decisions about `switch` and other
    feature-gated constructs (#4038)
  - phase-block (`BEGIN`/`END`/`INIT`/`UNITCHECK`/`CHECK`) pragmas are kept
    lexically scoped instead of leaking to the enclosing file; the bad
    `strict_warnings` phase-block override that suppressed PL100/PL101 is
    gone (#4108)

- **Incremental parsing: segment-based token cache + two-sided checkpoint
  window** — replaces the monolithic `TokenCache` with sorted segment storage
  so edits only invalidate overlapping segments, and `CheckpointCache::find_after()`
  bounds the re-lex region by the nearest left and right checkpoints instead of
  a fixed +100-byte heuristic. New `IncrementalStats` counters surface
  segment reuse, invalidation, and relex distance. 23 new correctness tests
  plus a 13-group Criterion benchmark suite. A follow-up correctness fix
  forces a full reparse when a nonzero checkpoint window has no cached prefix
  tokens, preventing a suffix-only token stream from being fed to the parser.
  (#4029, #4048, #4076)

- **Workspace-wide file-operations refactoring** — `workspace/willRenameFiles`
  now plans edits across unopened files by reading from the open-doc cache,
  the workspace index, and finally the filesystem; `workspace/willDeleteFiles`
  emits a user-visible `Warning` when deletion would break cross-file
  references discovered via `index.file_symbols()` + `find_references()`.
  Multi-file rename batches are merged per-URI via a new `append_workspace_edits`
  helper. (#4056, #4098)

- **`workspace/configuration` reverse-request flow** — the server now parses
  the client's `workspace.configuration` capability and, when advertised,
  issues a `workspace/configuration` reverse request per folder after
  `.perl-lsp.toml` is loaded, merging returned overlays into each folder's
  `effective_workspace_config` (TOML stays the base layer). Re-fetched on
  `workspace/didChangeConfiguration`. JSON-RPC responses without `method`
  are routed as an internal `$/perl-lsp/clientResponse` pseudo-notification
  through the existing dispatch system. Non-`file://` workspace folder URIs
  (`vscode-remote://`, `untitled:`, etc.) are tolerated end-to-end —
  `to_file_path()` calls are routed through a file-only URI helper and
  non-filesystem folders are skipped during indexing scans. (#4093, #4059)

- **Windows extended-length path fix for external commands** — `Path::canonicalize`
  on Windows returns paths with the `\\?\` prefix, which Win32 APIs accept but
  `perl.exe` / `prove` / `yath` do not. `normalize_path_for_external_command`
  strips the prefix before every spawn site in `execute_command::provider`.
  Unblocks Run Tests, Run File, and Run Test Sub on Windows. (#4089)

- **Perl::Critic diagnostics UX overhaul** — Critic policy codes now carry
  `source: "perlcritic"` in the LSP surface and an explicit `data.fixable`
  list; three more policy aliases route to existing quick-fixes
  (`RequireUseStrict`, `RequireUseWarnings`, `ProhibitUnusedVariables`);
  missing `perlcritic` binary and invalid profiles surface as workspace
  warnings and health-check output instead of silently skipping. (#4113)

### Added

- **Workspace `workspace/configuration` reverse-request flow** with client
  capability gating, per-folder scoping, and JSON-RPC response routing via
  `$/perl-lsp/clientResponse` (#4093).

- **`workspace/willRenameFiles` workspace-wide planning** — reads text from
  open-doc cache, workspace index, or filesystem, and merges multi-URI edits
  via a new `append_workspace_edits` helper (#4056).

- **`workspace/willDeleteFiles` safe-delete warnings** — emits `Warning`
  severity diagnostic when the delete would break cross-file references
  discovered via `index.file_symbols()` + `find_references()` (#4056).

- **`HoverExtracted::InheritedMethod` variant** with Phase 2 workspace BFS
  over parents and roles; `collect_all_package_members` BFS for workspace
  completion; `workspace_document_text` exposed as `pub(super)` so hover can
  reuse it (#4077).

- **AUTOLOAD fallback in goto-definition and hover** — explicit method-call
  navigation resolves through `AUTOLOAD` when the named method is absent;
  inherited-method hover surfaces the AUTOLOAD resolution (#4091).

- **`Readonly` and `Const::Fast` wrapper declarations** are now surfaced as
  constant symbols by `perl-symbol-surface` and `perl-semantic-analyzer`;
  declaration tokens are marked readonly in semantic-tokens output, including
  package-qualified `our` constants. Scalar, array, hash, and package
  regression coverage added. (#4040, #4043)

- **LSP semantic token delta support advertised** — `semanticTokens.full`
  switched from the legacy boolean form to the structured delta form.
  The delta handler already existed; the advertised capability is now
  aligned with LSP 3.16+ expectations. Capability-snapshot tests
  regenerated. (#4026, #4041, #4042)

- **VS Code: Run Test at Cursor** — new `perl-lsp.runTestAtCursor` command
  palette / context-menu entry that resolves the active cursor position
  against existing code lenses and runs the nearest test subroutine,
  subtest, or file-level run lens (#4025).

- **VS Code: Gherkin step-definition navigation and stubs** — navigation
  from `.feature` steps to Perl `Given`/`When`/`Then` definitions plus a
  quick-fix command that generates step-definition stubs. Unit coverage
  for matching, generation, and registration. (#4024)

- **VS Code test runner now prefers `yath` for test files** when present
  on PATH, with `prove` and `perl` fallbacks intact. Unit tests pin the
  runner preference order without depending on local tool availability.
  (#4031)

- **Segment-based incremental token cache + two-sided checkpoint window**
  — `TokenSegment` sorted storage, `CheckpointCache::find_after()`, and
  `reparse_from_checkpoint_two_sided`; new `IncrementalStats` metrics
  (`segments_reused_before`, `segments_reused_after`, `segments_invalidated`,
  `full_tail_fallbacks`, `left_checkpoint_distance`,
  `right_checkpoint_distance`, `bytes_relexed`); 23 correctness tests and
  a 13-group Criterion benchmark suite (#4029).

- **Orphaned unclosed-block recovery tests wired into `perl-parser-core`**
  — the `unclosed_block_recovery_tests` module existed on disk with six
  well-written tests but was never registered in `mod.rs` and had never
  compiled. Now wired with six additional edge-case tests covering C-style
  `for`, `foreach`, `unless`, `BEGIN` phase blocks, doubly-nested unclosed
  blocks, and nested blocks inside `sub`. (#4079)

- **Symbol visibility regression tests** for Error-partial recursion in
  `perl-semantic-analyzer`, covering arrow-truncation errors, unclosed-sub
  recovery, and missing-RHS recovery (#4071).

- **Per-edit checkpoint and cache delta assertions** for incremental
  parsing, replacing cumulative-counter assertions with per-edit deltas
  and tree-equivalence checks against a fresh full parse (#4076).

- **`require VERSION` pragma semantics test** guarding that `require 5.x`
  does not enable strict or warnings in `PragmaTracker` (#4023).

### Changed

- **Pre-push hook switched from `ci-gate` to `pr-fast`** (Tier A). The
  generated `hooks/pre-push` file is regenerated from `perl-ci-hygiene` and
  a regression test keeps the generated text and checked-in hook file in
  sync. `ci-gate` remains documented as the explicit full merge gate.
  (#4088, #4110)

- **Doc-only pre-push fast path skips code gates entirely** instead of
  running workspace-wide `cargo fmt --all -- --check`. Avoids a Windows
  long-path rustfmt crash on prose-only pushes. Regression test asserts
  the doc-only branch exits before any workspace-wide rustfmt check.
  (#4061)

- **Docs-only merge fast-track** added to the review/merge policy so
  doc-only PRs no longer falsely require `reviewed-deep`. Enforced by
  `scripts/pre-merge-check.sh` with shell-test coverage; reviewer / ops
  docs and label automation updated to match. (#4103)

- **`PragmaTracker::state_for_offset(&map, usize::MAX)`** is now the
  single authoritative source of truth for top-level pragma state in
  `check_strict_warnings`; the scope-unaware `walk_node` closure arms
  that scanned eval/sub interiors are removed (#4052).

- **`SymbolExtractor::visit_node()` Error arm** now recurses into
  `partial: Option<Box<Node>>` instead of treating Error as an opaque
  leaf, bringing symbol extraction into parity with every other
  traversal in the codebase (`semantic_tokens`, `class_model`,
  `scope_analyzer`, `for_each_child`) (#4071).

- **Metric framing scoped down** across README, VSCode marketplace
  listing, and v0.13.0 announcement draft — capabilities are now framed
  as advertised surface, not claimed conformance; entry-points table
  added to README; known UX gaps listed explicitly (#4045,
  #4046, #4049, #4051).

### Fixed

- **Parser error recovery and symbol extraction under partial `Error` nodes**
  — unclosed block recovery landed in `perl-parser-core` (PR #4079) and
  symbol extraction now descends into partial `Error` nodes (PR #4071),
  closing issue [#3499](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/issues/3499).

- **Navigation: inherited and role methods in goto-def, hover, and
  completion** — BFS traversal now chains `model.roles` alongside
  `model.parents` in `inherited_method_definition_location`; hover
  wires the previously dead-code `resolve_inherited_method_hover` path;
  workspace completion uses a new `collect_all_package_members` BFS that
  replaces the direct `get_package_members` call in
  `add_workspace_method_completions` (#4077).

- **Navigation: AUTOLOAD-backed method calls** resolve through
  `AUTOLOAD` fallback in both goto-definition and hover when the named
  method is absent (#4091).

- **Diagnostics: eval- and sub-scoped pragmas no longer suppress
  file-level PL100/PL101** — `pragma_map.iter().any()` replaced with
  `PragmaTracker::state_for_offset` at `usize::MAX`; `walk_node` closure
  arms that descended into `NodeKind::Eval` / `NodeKind::Subroutine`
  bodies and falsely set `has_strict = true` are removed. 4 new tests
  cover eval-scoped and sub-scoped false-negative paths. (#4052)

- **Pragma: phase-block pragmas kept lexically scoped** — `BEGIN`, `END`,
  `INIT`, `UNITCHECK`, and `CHECK` block pragmas no longer leak to file
  scope; the bad `strict_warnings` phase-block override that suppressed
  PL100/PL101 is removed. Replaced with behavior-spec and integration
  coverage for block-local semantics. (#4108)

- **Pragma: conditional `use if` / `use unless`** — `PragmaTracker`
  recognises `use if CONDITION, MODULE, ...` forms and conservatively
  applies the tracked pragma semantics from the suffix target. Lint
  pipeline regressions confirm conditional strict/warnings suppress the
  missing-pragma hints. (#4050)

- **Pragma: explicit `use feature qw(...)` and `:X.Y` bundles** tracked
  in `PragmaTracker`; `version_compat` understands feature bundles; 
  `no feature` lexical disablement is honored. Regressions cover
  `switch` enablement via bundles and lexical disablement. (#4038)

- **Incremental parsing: prefix correctness at checkpoint boundaries** —
  when a nonzero checkpoint window has no cached prefix tokens, fall
  back to a full reparse instead of assembling a suffix-only token
  stream for `Parser::from_tokens`. Regression compares incremental vs
  full parse for an edit past the first checkpoint boundary. (#4048)

- **Semantic analyzer: symbol extraction descends into Error partial
  nodes** (#4071). The arrow-truncation recovery path will start
  producing new symbols if the parser begins wrapping declarations in
  `Error { partial: Some(...) }`.

- **Workspace: non-`file://` URIs tolerated as workspace roots** —
  `vscode-remote://`, `untitled:`, and other virtual schemes are kept
  in LSP string form; direct `to_file_path()` calls are routed through
  a file-only URI helper; workspace folder matching normalises trailing
  slashes; non-filesystem folders are skipped during indexing scans.
  (#4059)

- **Execute-command: Windows extended-length path prefix stripped** —
  `normalize_path_for_external_command` removes the `\\?\` prefix on
  Windows at every spawn site in `execute_command::provider` (yath,
  prove, perl primary and fallback paths, `run_test_sub`, `run_file`).
  Non-Windows is a zero-cost identity via `#[cfg(windows)]`. Closes
  the Windows Run Tests regression. (#4089)

- **DAP types: basename derivation for Windows-style source paths** —
  `Source::new()` adds a narrow fallback when `Path::file_name()` returns
  the entire input string (as it does for backslash-separated paths on
  Unix hosts), so `C:\Users\dev\project\lib\Module.pm` now derives
  `Module.pm` correctly. Unblocks the previously-failing
  `source_with_windows_path` regression. (#4028)

- **Xtask `features verify` repaired** — catalog test paths are now
  resolved from repo root, the advertised-vs-caps snapshot is read from
  `crates/perl-lsp-rs/tests/snapshots/...`, the two-document Insta snapshot
  format is parsed correctly, and the verifier compares against the
  capability-backed advertised LSP subset (#4033).

- **Clippy hygiene: hover/navigation `let_and_return` and
  `needless_borrow`** warnings cleared, plus a follow-up
  `needless_borrow` fix in workspace file-ops after #4052 and #4088
  landed (#4037, #4098).

- **Plan-review hook IO hardened** — `subagent-stop.sh` binds issue
  context from `ISSUE_NUMBER`, payload `issue_number`, or the canonical
  `plan-review-NNN` agent name (in that precedence), instead of the
  broken branch-digit scan that silently labeled random historical
  issues. Fail-loud exit 3 when no valid issue context exists. Both
  `subagent-stop.sh` and `task-completed.sh` normalise payload / receipt
  fields with `tr -d '\r'` so JSONL metrics and CRLF-sensitive receipt
  parsing no longer reject valid UTC timestamps. Canonical
  `plan-review-NNN` naming documented in `.claude/commands/swarm.md`.
  Regression coverage added in both `.ci/scripts/test-hooks.sh` and
  `cargo xtask hook-tests`. (#4064)

- **CI hygiene: allowlisted production panic paths normalised** before
  matching so both Unix and Windows-style relative paths are recognised
  (#4081).

- **CI hygiene: doc-only pre-push fast path skips code gates** entirely
  instead of running workspace-wide rustfmt (#4061).

- **Semantic-analyzer: stale method attribute assertion** fixed to look
  up extracted methods via the current symbol contract while keeping the
  attribute-preservation assertion intact (#4082).

- **Agent definitions: terminal skills made explicit** — `scout-lsp.md`
  gains the missing step 9 `/agent-wrapup` (every other scout variant
  already had it); `reviewer-deep.md` restructures step 4 and adds a
  new step 5 making `/pr-ready` an explicit required follow-up when
  the deep-review decision is "approve". Root cause for the earlier
  incidents where deep reviewers set `reviewed-deep` but forgot to
  call `/pr-ready`, leaving PRs stuck in draft. (#4087)

### Docs

- **Metric framing scoped down** — README, VSCode marketplace listing,
  and v0.13.0 announcement draft now frame capabilities as advertised
  surface, not claimed conformance. README gains an entry-points table
  and an explicit list of known UX gaps. (#4045, #4046, #4049, #4051)

### Tests / Quality

- **Test-side P0 idiom + dependency findings burned down** — three
  `.or_insert_with(Vec::new)` occurrences migrated to `.or_default()`
  in `lsp_cancellation_performance_tests.rs`,
  `test_infrastructure_mocks.rs`, and
  `documentation_validation_mutation_hardening.rs`; explicit
  `HashMap<String, Vec<Duration>>` / `HashMap<String, Vec<usize>>` type
  annotations added where inference became ambiguous;
  `perl-tdd-support` added to `[dev-dependencies]` in `perl-dap-types`,
  `perl-symbol-surface`, and `perl-ast-utils`. (#4002)

- **Match-arm panic asserts burned down** in test code across
  `perl-dap-variables`, `perl-lexer` interpolation tests, and several
  other test suites, continuing the long-running #3258 burn-down
  (#4030, #4032, #4035).

<!-- 2026-04-11 session addendum: PRs merged after the initial changelog entry was written -->

### Added (addendum)

- **Phase-scoped pragma diagnostics** (`PL502`, `PL503`) — new diagnostics flag
  `use strict` / `use warnings` placed inside phase blocks (`BEGIN`, `END`, `INIT`,
  `CHECK`, `UNITCHECK`) where they have lexical block scope rather than file scope;
  quick fixes move the pragmas to file scope preserving shebangs. (#4131)

- **`cargo xtask check-test-wiring` CLI command wired** — PR #4119 added the
  `check_test_wiring` module but omitted the `use` import in `main.rs`; the
  subcommand was returning "unrecognized subcommand". Now fully wired; also fixes
  one genuine orphan discovered by the guard: `crates/perl-lsp-rs/tests/fixtures/integration_example.rs`.
  (#4151)

- **Cross-file `use constant` and parenthesized import lists** — `find_import_source()`
  strips quotes from string args before comparison so `use Foo ('bar', 'baz')` resolves
  via goto-def; `use constant` re-exports are followed across file boundaries. (#4133)

### Changed (addendum)

- **Multi-root workspace integration tests activated in nightly gate** — the 8
  integration tests in `multi_root_workspace_tests.rs` (added in #3984, never run in CI)
  are now wired via a new `ci-workspace-multiroot` justfile recipe, placed in the
  nightly gate only until proven stable. (#4137)

### Fixed (addendum)

- **Hotfix: red master from `check_test_wiring` regex and clippy** — two runtime
  `Regex::new(...).expect(...)` calls in `check_test_wiring.rs` migrated to
  `LazyLock<Regex>` statics; `let_and_return` clippy warning in `parser_corpus_sweep`
  removed; `RUSTSEC-2026-0097` suppressed in audit paths with follow-up in #4149.
  (#4150)

- **Status: feature maturity metadata restored** — valid `maturity` value reinstated
  for the phase-scoped pragma diagnostic capability after #4131 introduced an
  invalid value; `xtask update-status --check` green again. (#4148)

- **DevEx: detect stale installed pre-push hooks** — `just status-check` now compares
  the installed `.git/hooks/pre-push` against the canonical checked-in `hooks/pre-push`,
  normalising CRLF and trailing-blank-line noise. (#4144)

### Tests / Quality (addendum)

- **Perl::Critic missing profile path test** — regression test for an explicitly
  configured but missing Perl::Critic profile path; asserts subprocess is skipped and
  no policy diagnostics are returned. (#4139)

### Added (2026-04-12)

- **DAP launch-success scorecard** — new integration harness measures DAP cold-launch
  pass rate across 5 fixture debuggees (hello, loops, eval, args, begin_end) with
  P50/P95 latency metrics; a new `docs/project/status/dap.md` page surfaces DAP
  coverage alongside the existing LSP status pages. (#4237)

- **Editor UX receipt** — machine-readable `docs/project/status/editor_ux.json`
  receipt generated by `xtask update-status` tracks the editor UX fixture matrix
  pass rate, wired into `quality.md` and the status index. (#4233, #4234)

### Fixed (2026-04-12)

- **Rename operations no longer lag on large files** — `collect_descendant_scopes`
  replaced O(n×d) parent-chain walk with a single O(n) map build + iterative BFS,
  with a cycle guard preventing hangs on pathological self-referential parent links.
  (#4240)

### Changed (2026-04-12)

- **Research-verifier is now the default for claim-heavy PRs** — agent skill
  definitions encode the research-verifier dispatch policy so orchestrators no longer
  need a reminder; claim-heavy criteria defined in three skill files. (#4235)

### Documentation (2026-04-12)

- **`perl-lsp-semantic-tokens` crate docs corrected** — CLAUDE.md updated from
  stale 15 types/7 modifiers to the actual 23 types/13 modifiers, with all token
  types and modifiers listed in index order and Perl-specific extensions called out.
  (#4239)

### Added (2026-04-12 session 2)

- **Compile-time constants hover** — `__FILE__`, `__LINE__`, `__PACKAGE__`, and
  `__SUB__` now show rich hover documentation with descriptions and caveats
  (e.g. `__SUB__` in named subs vs anonymous subs). (#4270, #4294)

- **Fast/slow diagnostic split** — parse errors are now published immediately
  (~440ms sooner) via `publish_parse_errors_fast()`, then replaced by the full
  diagnostic set on the 250ms debounce. Users see red squiggles while typing
  without waiting for scope analysis or perlcritic. (#4279, #4305)

- **Generation-aware staleness guard** — if a `didChange` arrives during slow
  computation (scope analysis, perlcritic, dead-code), the stale diagnostic
  result is suppressed and the debouncer re-fires for the latest version. (#4295)

- **`require Module; Module->import('sym')` completion** — the two-statement
  require+import pattern is now recognised for completion ranking alongside
  `use Module` imports. (#3476, #4296)

- **Module ranking tiers for completion** — completion candidates are ranked
  by import tier (direct import > workspace > CPAN) with string-context
  suppression and open-snippet triggers for module paths. (#4263, #4277)

- **`workspace/configuration` folder propagation** — `didChangeConfiguration`
  now eagerly propagates settings to each folder's `effective_workspace_config`,
  closing a stale-settings window between notification and async pull response.
  (#3515, #4289, #4307)

- **Safe-delete widened dependent detection** — `workspace/willDeleteFiles`
  now detects dependents via both `use` imports and `require` statements,
  surfacing warnings for a broader set of cross-file references. (#3513, #4293)

- **Package declaration rewrite during module rename** — `workspace/willRenameFiles`
  now rewrites `package Foo::Bar` declarations inside the renamed file to match
  the new module path. (#3522, #4291)

### Fixed (2026-04-12 session 2)

- **Package name hover** — hovering a qualified package name like `File::Path`
  previously showed broken hover text because the tokenizer stopped at `:`.
  New `get_package_name_at_position` scans across `::` separators to produce
  correct rich hover with file path, POD, and MetaCPAN link. (#4282, #4306)

- **Signature/Prototype AST byte-span** — `Signature` and `Prototype` nodes
  now carry the correct byte span from the parser, fixing off-by-one ranges
  in hover and semantic tokens. (#4243, #4281)

- **Windows compatibility** — `/proc` reads guarded behind `cfg(target_os = "linux")`;
  hardcoded `/tmp` paths replaced with `std::env::temp_dir()` for cross-platform
  correctness. (#4229, #4278)

### Tests / Quality (2026-04-12 session 2)

- **Cross-folder rename verification** — integration tests verify rename operations
  span both workspace roots correctly. (#3522, #4273, #4292)

- **Import visibility regression tests** — unit tests for `require`+`import`
  symbol resolution patterns. (#3476, #4286)

- **Heredoc `unreachable!` ratchet coverage** — tests cover all 7 heredoc
  unreachable patterns on both path separators. (#4245, #4274)

- **Unused dev-dependencies removed** from 5 crates. (#4183, #4255)


## [0.12.3] - 2026-04-09

Release notes: [v0.12.3](docs/releases/v0.12.3.md) · [GitHub Release](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/releases/tag/v0.12.3)

<!-- Pipeline rehearsal release — validates the full publish + extension + Docker cycle before v0.13.0 public alpha -->
<!-- Rolls up publish pipeline fixes, UX P0 improvements, and CI hardening from Waves 10/11/12 -->

### Headlines

- **`tree-sitter-perl-c` first published to crates.io** — the conventional C grammar
  binding (tree-sitter FFI over the C parser) is now a proper published leaf crate,
  shedding its `libclang`/bindgen dependency in favour of vendored C sources compiled
  via `cc`. Framed as a compatibility and comparison surface alongside the native v3
  parser stack. (#3234)

- **Publish pipeline overhauled** — three layered fixes make the pipeline correct
  and fast: Tarjan SCC topological sort properly handles dev-dependency cycles (#3236);
  dev-dependencies are stripped from each manifest before publishing so circular
  workspace dev-deps no longer block `cargo publish` (#3254); and the registry
  indexing wait is replaced with progressive sparse-index probes that catch silent
  upload failures instead of proceeding on false success (#3230).

- **Archive: 7 dead tree-sitter harness crates removed from the workspace** — the
  old Pest-based `tree-sitter-perl-rs` harness and 6 `perl-ts-*` compatibility shims
  are moved to `archive/`, clearing the `tree-sitter-perl-rs` name for a planned
  Rust-native tree-sitter-style facade over the v3 parser. (#3244, #3250)

- **DevEx polish** — `just doctor` auto-detects and self-heals recurring worktree
  state-corruption bugs; the pre-push hook gains a doc-only fast path and
  self-heals `core.bare=true` corruption; `just bump-version` centralises
  version sync across 191 sites. (#3249, #3238, #3228)

- **Quality burn-down** — ~210 `eprintln!` calls in library crates migrated to
  structured `tracing` macros; three waves of `unwrap`/`expect` eliminations across
  test code; two dead `build.rs` files removed that were causing unnecessary
  recompiles. (#3245, #3229, #3241)

### Added

- **`just doctor`**: one-stop workspace health-check that auto-detects and
  (where safe) auto-fixes recurring state-corruption bugs — `core.bare=true`,
  stale branches, worktree file leaks, orphaned worktree directories, and missing
  pre-push hook. (#3249)

- **`just bump-version`**: centralised version-sync command covering all 191
  version sites (workspace Cargo.toml, every crate manifest, VS Code extension
  manifest and lockfile, `features.toml`, README, CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP). Paired with
  an updated `check-version-sync` gate that now covers all the same sites, so drift
  cannot go undetected. (#3228)

- **`perl-heredoc-anti-patterns` microcrate**: SRP extraction of
  `anti_pattern_detector` from the larger `perl-ts-heredoc-analysis` crate, which
  is now archived. The only part that production code consumed is now a clean
  publishable leaf crate. (#3199)

- **`perl-parser-bench` microcrate**: SRP extraction of the `bench_parser` binary
  that was misplaced inside the tree-sitter-perl-rs harness. Uses `perl-parser`
  (v3 native) directly. (#3198)

- **`perl-parser-pest` published to crates.io**: the legacy v2 Pest-based Perl
  parser is now a published crate, available as a learning tool and Pest reference
  implementation for the broader Perl-in-Rust ecosystem. (#3195)

- **`perl-lsp-ai-provider` published to crates.io**: filled out crates.io metadata
  and added to the publish allow-list. This was a blocker for `perl-lsp-rs`
  publication. (#3196)

- **4 orphaned workspace members registered**: `perl-workspace-folder`,
  `perl-dap-stack`, `perl-lsp-feature-policy`, and `perl-lsp-formatting-types`
  were referenced throughout the workspace but missing from `[workspace] members`,
  causing them to be silently skipped by every workspace-wide CI gate. (#3232)

- **AI streaming tests**: mock streaming-backend coverage for progress, cancel,
  and error paths; final stream sequence field assertion; relaxed error-path
  assertion for terminal final event. (#3170, #3172, #3174, #3175)

- **CPAN corpus caching in CI**: CPAN corpus is now installed and cached before
  the ratchet step, preventing spurious corpus-ratchet failures on clean CI runs.
  (#3173)

### Changed

- **`tree-sitter-perl-c` is now publishable**: vendored C sources compiled via
  `cc` replace the `libclang`/bindgen build step entirely; the single hand-written
  FFI symbol was already sufficient. Crate brought into the workspace as a proper
  member. (#3234)

- **xtask now depends on standalone crates directly**: dev tooling in `xtask` and
  `scripts/test_recursion.rs` was swapped off the archived tree-sitter-perl harness
  onto `perl-parser-pest` (Rust parser) and `tree-sitter-perl-c` (C FFI) directly,
  removing the harness's last consumers before archival. (#3206)

- **`just quick-bench` fixed to actually compare C vs Rust parsers**: previously
  both columns invoked the same `perl-parser-bench` binary (comparing a warm vs
  cold run of the native parser). The C column now invokes `bench_parser_c` from
  `tree-sitter-perl-c`, so the speedup column reflects a real C vs Rust comparison.
  (#3204, #3253)

- **Pre-push hook smarter**: doc-only fast path (markdown/text/license/docs changes
  run `cargo fmt --check` only, skip the full ci-gate); self-heals `core.bare=true`
  corruption before any git operation. (#3238)

- **Publish workflow indexing wait replaced with sparse-index probes**: progressive
  probe at 5s/15s/45s/90s elapsed replaces a fixed 5-minute wait; each crate is
  verified via the crates.io sparse index after publish; the final verify job runs
  unconditionally (`if: always()`) and lists exactly which crates failed. (#3230)

- **`eprintln!` → `tracing` in library code**: ~210 `eprintln!` calls across
  library crates replaced with structured `tracing` macros at appropriate levels
  (warn/error for failures, info for lifecycle, debug/trace for routine output).
  `tracing` added to 6 crates that lacked it. (#3224, #3245)

- **Documentation framing updated**: README Architecture section names the native
  parser/lexer/analysis stack as the architectural centre, distinguishes
  `tree-sitter-perl-c` (C FFI reference, maintained for compatibility) from the
  planned `tree-sitter-perl-rs` facade (Rust-native, in development), and frames
  tree-sitter compatibility as an interoperability surface. (#3247)

- **Per-crate CLAUDE.md headers refreshed** post-archive of tree-sitter harness
  crates. Stale references to archived crates removed. (#3240)

### Fixed

- **Publish: dev-dependency cycles no longer block `cargo publish`** — dev-deps
  are stripped from each crate's `Cargo.toml` before publishing (and restored
  afterward via a `trap` on EXIT). Fixes the 3-crate dev-dep cycle
  (`perl-parser-core` / `perl-tdd-support` / `perl-corpus`) that caused publish
  order failures. (#3254, #3256)

- **Publish: Tarjan SCC topological sort for dev-dep edges** — the previous sort
  excluded dev-dep edges, causing crates that dev-depend on later-published siblings
  to be ordered before them. The fix includes dev-dep edges in the graph, uses
  Tarjan SCC to find strongly-connected components, and retains only inter-SCC
  dev-dep edges (intra-SCC edges are the only ones that can close a cycle).
  (#3236, #3242)

- **Publish: `perl-test-must` published before `perl-tdd-support`** — ordering
  fix for the initial publish sequence that caused `perl-tdd-support` to land
  before its dependency. (#3176, #3177)

- **Corpus ratchet path mismatch** (#3189 / #3257): xtask's CPAN corpus paths are
  now anchored at the workspace root (via `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")` at build
  time) rather than resolved against `std::env::current_dir()`. The workflow's
  `test -d` step is aligned to the same absolute path. Regression-guarded by a
  unit test that asserts `workspace_root()` contains a top-level `Cargo.toml`.

- **`hook-tests` workspace scribble** (#3203 / #3246): the hook-test scaffold's
  throwaway git repo inherited `core.hooksPath` from the parent environment,
  causing the parent pre-commit hook to fire inside the temp repo. In one observed
  run the temp repo's `README.md` write landed on the real workspace `README.md`.
  The temp repo is now explicitly isolated with `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1` and
  `core.hooksPath` cleared; temp dirs are created under `$TMPDIR` not the
  workspace root.

- **Windows xtask file-lock** (#3202 / #3241): two dead `build.rs` files removed —
  the root `build.rs` (workspace-only manifest, never run by cargo) and
  `crates/perl-parser/build.rs` (set environment variables that nothing read, and
  marked `perl-parser` dirty on every commit via `.git/HEAD` rerun-if-changed
  directives, propagating unnecessary rebuilds to all 50+ dependents).

- **Windows xtask: recursive subprocess eliminated** (#3221): `cmd_check_parse_errors`
  was spawning xtask as a subprocess of itself, which caused `Access is denied` (os
  error 5) on Windows due to the write-lock on the running executable. The inner
  call is now replaced with a direct function call.

- **Windows xtask: backslash mangling in `smoke-test-release.sh`** (#3214): absolute
  Windows `PathBuf` paths passed to `bash` as arguments caused backslash-escape
  collapse. Fixed by using a relative path instead.

- **Triage workflow silently aborting** (#3235): the `triage-issues` workflow was
  failing on every run that encountered an issue needing labels, silently aborting
  at the first `add_labels` call.

- **`features.toml` dead test paths repaired**: 43 dead test paths corrected to
  match the current `crates/perl-lsp-rs/tests/` layout; the
  `experimental.perlInlineCompletionStream` feature row added (shipped in v0.12.2).
  (#3222, #3251)

- **`unsafe` block documented**: `GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent` FFI call in
  `perl-dap` now carries a SAFETY comment explaining why the call is sound.
  (#3232)

### Removed

- **Archived 7 dead tree-sitter harness crates** to `archive/crates/`:
  `tree-sitter-perl-rs` (old Pest-based harness), `perl-ts-heredoc-analysis`,
  `perl-ts-statement-tracker`, `perl-ts-logos-lexer`, `perl-ts-heredoc-parser`,
  `perl-ts-partial-ast`, `perl-ts-advanced-parsers`. All workspace references,
  CI exclusion lists, and benchmark function paths updated. (#3244, #3250)

- **Dead stray LICENSE files** in `crates/perl-corpus/`, `crates/perl-lexer/`,
  `crates/perl-parser/`: byte-identical orphan files not referenced by any
  `Cargo.toml` `license-file` field. (#3196)

### Dependencies

- `similar` 2.7.0 → 3.0.0 (#3184) — only consumer is xtask; breaking changes do
  not intersect our usage
- `actions/cache` v4 → v5 (#3181) — Node 24 runtime bump; existing caches remain
  readable
- `eslint` 9.39.4 → 10.2.0 (#3179) — flat config already in use; lint passes clean
- `tokio` 1.50.0 → 1.51.0 (#3180)
- `tree-sitter` 0.26.7 → 0.26.8 (#3182)
- dependencies group with 3 updates (#3183)
- npm group in vscode-extension (#3178)

### Publish pipeline fixes (post-v0.12.2 publish run lessons)

These fixes landed after the initial v0.12.2 publish run and directly address the
partial-publish (108/129) and cascading-failure patterns observed in production:

- **HTTP 429 throttle** (#3307): publish workflow detects crates.io rate-limit
  responses and retries with exponential back-off; the 21 crates that failed in
  the v0.12.2 publish run were blocked by 429s from rapid-fire publish attempts.

- **Publish allowlist extended** (#3296): `perl-workspace-index-monitoring` and
  `perl-test-generators` added to the publish allow-list after they were found
  missing from the v0.12.2 publish set.

- **LICENSE files corrected** (#3304): missing or incorrect `LICENSE` files added
  to 4 publishable crates (`perl-lsp-ai-provider`, `perl-workspace-index`,
  `tree-sitter-perl-rs`, `tree-sitter-perl-c`); crates.io rejects publishes with
  license-file fields pointing to absent files.

- **Duplicate `[package.metadata.docs.rs]` key** (#3315): `tree-sitter-perl-c`
  had two `[package.metadata.docs.rs]` tables in `Cargo.toml`; the duplicate key
  caused `cargo publish` to emit a parse warning and was silently dropped, causing
  docs.rs to build without the intended features. Resolved by merging the two
  tables.

- **Continue-on-failure** (#3316): publish loop now tracks failures in a
  `FAILED_CRATES` array instead of `exit 1` immediately; all topologically-ready
  crates are attempted even when an earlier crate fails. On v0.12.2 run
  24126423987, 19 crates were blocked by a single cascade; on run 24133403944,
  22 crates were blocked. Re-runs safely skip already-published crates via the
  sparse-index check.

- **`tree-sitter-perl-c` polish for first publish** (#3273): vendored sources and
  FFI bindings verified clean for crates.io submission; duplicate metadata resolved
  (#3315 above).

- **docs.rs metadata** (#3299): `[package.metadata.docs.rs]` blocks added or
  corrected for feature-gated crates across the workspace; enables docs.rs to
  build documentation with the correct feature flags set.

- **Publish dry-run gate** (#3301): new CI check runs `cargo publish --dry-run` on
  every PR that modifies a `Cargo.toml`, catching publish-time errors (missing
  files, bad metadata, syntax) before they reach the release pipeline.

### UX fixes (P0 launch blockers)

Five actionability fixes for user-visible error paths that surfaced during the
v0.12.2 publish run and post-publish testing:

- **Actionable binary download errors** (#3306): extension now shows a specific
  message with platform, arch, and download URL when the LSP server binary cannot
  be fetched, instead of a generic network failure.

- **LSP startup error diagnosis** (#3308): `classifyStartupError()` maps stderr
  signatures (GLIBC version mismatch, missing shared library, Exec format error,
  permission denied) to actionable hints and remediation steps; reorders error
  dialog actions so "View Logs" appears before "Reinstall".

- **Workspace root detection warning** (#3309): when the workspace root cannot be
  determined, the server now emits a `window/showMessage` warning with the detected
  state instead of failing silently. Previously users had no indication of why
  features were degraded.

- **Enterprise binary distribution note** (#3310): documentation updated to
  explain that `perllsp` is distributed as a pre-compiled binary via `cargo
  install`, with offline-install guidance for air-gapped enterprise environments.

- **Perl interpreter missing error** (#3312): when `perl` is not found on `$PATH`,
  the extension shows the exact binary name searched and a platform-specific
  installation suggestion, replacing the previous "Perl not found" dead end.

### CI hardening

- **SHA-pinned third-party Actions** (#3294): all `uses:` references to third-party
  GitHub Actions pinned to immutable commit SHAs with version comments (e.g.,
  `uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 # v4.2.2`).
  Prevents supply-chain attacks via tag mutation.

- **GIT_DIR cleared in hook-tests** (#3318): xtask hook-test scaffold now runs
  with `GIT_DIR` unset, preventing the worktree's inherited `GIT_DIR` value from
  causing git commands inside the temp repo to resolve against the wrong object
  store. Observed contamination: test-repo commits were silently landing in the
  agent worktree.

- **UX regression gate** (#3293): new CI check detects regressions in user-visible
  LSP, DAP, and extension behaviour on every PR that touches those surfaces.
  Backed by the UX test harness framework (#3297).

- **UX test harness framework** (#3297): systematic framework for UX regression
  tests with helpers for LSP, DAP, and extension surface validation.

## [0.12.2] - 2026-04-04

Release notes: [v0.12.2](docs/releases/v0.12.2.md) · [GitHub Release](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/releases/tag/v0.12.2)

`v0.12.2` is the confidence-building release for the 0.12.x series. 89 commits
across 59 PRs spanning new features, performance, testing, distribution, and
documentation. The entire 0.12.x roadmap from v0.12.2 through v0.12.8 milestones
is consolidated into this single release.

The v0.12.2 publish run extended the original GitHub Release with a wave of
quality, distribution, and CI infrastructure work needed to land the full crate
set on crates.io. 108 of 129 crates published successfully in the first attempt;
the remaining 21 (including `tree-sitter-perl-c`, `tree-sitter-perl-rs`,
`perl-parser`, `perl-lsp-rs`, `perllsp`, `perl-dap`) will retry after the HTTP
429 throttle fix lands.

### New Crates (first publish)

- **`tree-sitter-perl-rs`**: v3 ergonomic facade over the native parser stack,
  published alongside `tree-sitter-perl-c` for projects that want tree-sitter
  call ergonomics on top of the Rust-native parser (#3255)
- **`tree-sitter-perl-c`**: conventional C-binding crate for the tree-sitter
  grammar, now publishable on crates.io (#3234)

### Added

  session management, cancellation, and deterministic fallback when AI is off
  (#3157–#3168)
- **heredoc language injection**: SQL keyword and JSON key detection in heredocs
  with multi-heredoc-per-line support (#3134)

  on hover (#3150)
- **dead code highlighting**: `DiagnosticTag::Unnecessary` for unreachable code
  (#3092)
- **extract variable/subroutine**: AST-aware code action for extracting
  expressions and blocks (#3090)
- **subroutine inlining**: code action to inline simple subroutines (#3083)
- **POD preview panel**: VS Code command `Perl: Preview POD` (#3131)

  Linux/macOS/Windows (#3117)
- **context-sensitive quote parsing**: `qw`, `s///`, `tr///` disambiguation in
  complex expressions (#3105)
- **semantic framework coverage**: inheritance and export analysis for Moo/Moose
  patterns (#3103)
- **Linux/macOS installer**: fixed and improved install script (#3122)
- **streaming inline completion controller**: VS Code gating on AI config flags
  (#3161, #3164)

### Performance

- **incremental parsing pipeline**: token caching (#3116), checkpoint recovery
  (#3114), and `Parser::from_tokens` (#3128) complete the incremental path
- **CPAN-scale benchmarks**: 10K files indexed in 672ms, 500K symbol lookup in
  10.6µs (#3121, #3132)
- **large-workspace HashMap optimization**: faster startup for big projects
  (#3112)
- **memory profiling infrastructure**: heap tracking for workspace indexing
  (#3125)
- **completion latency benchmarks**: baseline for regression detection (#3104)

### Fixed

- **DAP attach cleanup**: removed stale mock stub and updated tests (#3135)
- **perlcritic integration**: hardened diagnostic pipeline (#3097)
- **silent error handling**: 23+ silently swallowed errors now emit trace logs
  (#3087, #3151)
- **distribution binary name**: Linux packaging templates and Windows bump
  workflows aligned with `perllsp` (#3106, #3144)
- **Homebrew asset names**: brew-bump workflow aligned (#3120)
- **CI efficiency**: 10 improvements reducing CI minutes (#3156)

### Quality (publish-run additions)

- **`eprintln!` → `tracing`**: migrated all `eprintln!` / `println!` calls in
  library code to structured `tracing` spans/events; `eprintln!` now banned in
  non-binary crates (#3224, #3245)

## [0.12.1] - 2026-03-31

Release notes: [v0.12.1](docs/releases/v0.12.1.md) · [GitHub Release](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/releases/tag/v0.12.1)

`v0.12.1` is the fix-forward cut after the initial public alpha release. It does
not reopen the wider alpha scope; it closes the release-surface regressions that
slipped into the first `v0.12.0` tag and keeps the install and publish story
aligned.

### Fixed

- restored the top-level README and release-facing docs so the source snapshot
  no longer presents hook-test fixture content as the project front page
- hardened hook-test fixture setup so temporary repos must live outside the real
  checkout and seed commits no longer write placeholder git identities into repo
  config
- fixed local git-hook installation for worktrees and added pre-commit blocking
  for the known placeholder identities used by release and hook tests

### Changed

- workspace, feature-catalog, VS Code extension, and operator release surfaces
  now target `0.12.1`
- status and roadmap docs now treat `v0.12.0` as the latest published GitHub
  release and `v0.12.1` as the active fix-forward cut

## [0.12.0] - 2026-03-30

Release notes: [v0.12.0](docs/releases/v0.12.0.md) · [GitHub Release](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/releases/tag/v0.12.0)

`v0.12.0` is the initial public alpha for the native Rust Perl 5 toolchain. The
headline change is not one feature in isolation; it is that the parser, language
server, debugger, install surface, and release process now line up well enough
for normal editor use.

### Highlights

#### Native editor path

- `perllsp` and `perl-dap` are now treated as first-class native binaries for editor integration and debugging.
- VS Code, manual binary install, and release surfaces were tightened for first-run setup, health checks, and issue reporting.
- `.perl-lsp.toml` gives teams a shared, editor-agnostic project configuration layer.

#### Better day-to-day language tooling

- Completion, hover, diagnostics, formatting, semantic tokens, workspace symbols, code lens, and code actions all received broad hardening.
- Hover and completion coverage expanded for Perl built-ins, special variables, module flows, and workspace-aware suggestions.
- Diagnostic wiring now consistently surfaces parser, project, and optional Perl::Critic signals through the LSP pipeline.

#### Better real-world Perl coverage

- The native recursive-descent parser was hardened against curated common-corpus and CPAN-facing receipts instead of toy examples alone.
- Semantic and workspace layers improved cross-file navigation, rename, inheritance-aware lookups, and framework-aware behavior for Moo and Moose patterns.
- Workspace indexing, cancellation, timeouts, and runtime concurrency all received reliability work aimed at larger real projects.

#### Release and contributor surface

- Release prep, package-manager manifests, docs, validation receipts, and status pages were aligned for the public-alpha launch.
- The workspace continued its crate-boundary cleanup so parser, runtime, LSP, DAP, and release tooling are easier to reason about independently.

### Notable user-facing additions

- project config via `.perl-lsp.toml`
- richer hover coverage for special variables, built-ins, and framework-aware symbols
- broader completion coverage and improved ranking
- native DAP improvements for stepping, variables, and editor integration
- stronger workspace symbol, formatting, code action, and code lens support

### Notable fixes

- parser recovery and disambiguation across real Perl edge cases such as quote operators, slash parsing, prototypes, and framework-heavy code
- deadlock, contention, and stale-state fixes in the LSP runtime and workspace index
- safer handling for empty files, binary files, Windows and macOS path quirks, and shell-launch edge cases
- stale capability drift, unwired command paths, and release-surface documentation mismatches

For the detailed receipts behind this release, see [docs/project/CURRENT_STATUS.md](docs/project/CURRENT_STATUS.md) and [docs/project/status/index.md](docs/project/status/index.md).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-12

Release notes: [v0.11.0](docs/releases/v0.11.0.md) · [GitHub Release](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/releases/tag/v0.11.0)

> **Tag provenance correction.** The live `v0.11.0` ref is
> `8dfa68860cdf8fc220b1345d3b943668d1393ad2`; the previously recorded
> `d22ac7346c832db6b92c41d354eb90099f8b5d53` no longer resolves. The current
> tagged predecessor is `v0.9.1`, because `0.10.0` was changelog-only and the
> current `v0.8.5` / `v0.9.1` refs are divergent. Use
> [`v0.9.1...v0.11.0`](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/compare/v0.9.1...v0.11.0).

This release finalizes the 0.11.0 distribution pipeline across GitHub releases,
crates.io, and the VS Code extension so the workspace can ship from a single,
repeatable release flow.

### Added
- **Turnkey Release Orchestration**: A PR-driven release path now covers version
  bumping, changelog generation, tagging, GitHub release creation, crates.io
  publishing, extension publishing, and downstream package manager automation.
- **Topological crates.io Publishing**: Workspace publish automation computes
  dependency order from `cargo metadata` and publishes only the crates in the
  workspace allowlist.
- **Release Guardrails**: Release helper scripts now validate semver inputs and
  align manual operator flows with the automated `0.11.0` release path.

### Changed
- **Workspace Release Alignment**: Workspace packages, extension metadata, and
  release workflows now target `0.11.0`.
- **Release Tooling**: Legacy release helper scripts now delegate to the current
  GitHub workflow-based release flow instead of relying on stale one-off cargo
  publish steps and outdated examples.
- **Operator Documentation in Scripts**: Manual publish and smoke-test helpers
  now accept an explicit version argument and default to the matching `vX.Y.Z`
  release ref when dispatching workflows or validating published artifacts.

### Fixed
- **Stale Release Examples**: Removed hardcoded `0.8.3` release references from
  publish and smoke-test scripts that could misdirect manual release operations.
- **Publish Version Safety**: crates.io publishing now fails early when the
  workflow target version does not match the versions resolved for workspace
  crates scheduled for publication.
