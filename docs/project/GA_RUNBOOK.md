# GA Release Runbook (Forward-Looking)

> **Note**: This is a forward-looking planning document for a future GA release.
> The tree is at v0.17.0 (public beta) and the GA milestone has not been reached.
> Content below is retained as planning documentation.
>
> The worked examples still use v0.8.3 and have not been re-verified against the
> current release process. Steps 5, 8, and 9 have been corrected against the
> shipping asset names; treat the rest as a template to check, not a script to
> run. [`docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/blob/main/docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md)
> and [`RELEASE.md`](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/blob/main/RELEASE.md)
> are the current authority.

This document provides a template for a future general availability release.

## Day-of Release Process

### 1. Final Version Bump (5 min)

```bash
# Update version in all Cargo.toml files
VERSION="0.8.3"
sed -i "s/^version = \".*\"/version = \"$VERSION\"/" crates/perl-parser/Cargo.toml
sed -i "s/^version = \".*\"/version = \"$VERSION\"/" crates/perl-lexer/Cargo.toml
sed -i "s/^version = \".*\"/version = \"$VERSION\"/" crates/tree-sitter-perl-rs/Cargo.toml

# Update lock file
cargo update

# Verify builds
cargo build -p perllsp --bin perllsp --release
```

### 2. Create & Push Tag (2 min)

```bash
# Commit version changes
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: release v0.8.3

- Perl::Critic integration
- Enhanced UTF-16 position handling
- Property-based testing infrastructure
- 141/141 edge cases passing
- 35+ IDE features"

# Create and push tag
git tag -a "v0.8.3" -m "Release v0.8.3"
git push origin master
git push origin v0.8.3
```

### 3. Monitor CI Release (10-15 min)

1. Go to: https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/actions
2. Watch the "Release" workflow triggered by the tag
3. Verify all platform builds succeed
4. Check that artifacts are attached to the release

### 4. Get Checksums from Release (2 min)

Once the GitHub release is created:

1. Go to: https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/releases/tag/v0.8.3
2. Download `SHA256SUMS` file
3. Extract checksums for each platform:

```bash
# Example checksums (replace with actual values)
LINUX_X64_SHA256="abc123..."
LINUX_ARM64_SHA256="def456..."
MACOS_X64_SHA256="ghi789..."
MACOS_ARM64_SHA256="jkl012..."
WINDOWS_X64_SHA256="mno345..."
```

### 5. Update Installers with Checksums (5 min)

#### Update install.sh

```bash
# Already points to latest release, no changes needed
# Checksums are fetched from GitHub
```

#### Update install.ps1

```bash
# Already points to latest release, no changes needed
# Checksums are fetched from GitHub
```

#### Sync both installers to the publication repo — required

Users fetch `install.sh` and `install.ps1` from the publication repo
(`EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp`, branch `master`), not from this one. Neither
script is version-pinned, so no per-release edit is needed — but the
publication copy must actually match this repository.

It currently does not. The published `install.ps1` still carries the
pre-rename `$Name = "perl-lsp"` and therefore builds an asset name that does
not exist:

```text
perllsp-0.17.0-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip   -> 200
perl-lsp-0.17.0-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip  -> 404
```

Verify the publication copy before announcing a release:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/master/install.ps1 \
  | grep '^\$Name'   # must print: $Name = "perllsp"
```

If it does not match, sync the publication repo
([#4348](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/issues/4348))
before publishing any Windows install instruction. Until then, document the
manual archive for Windows
([#5461](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/issues/5461)).

### 6. Create Homebrew Formula (10 min)

Create a new repository `homebrew-tap` if it doesn't exist:

```bash
# Create tap repository
mkdir homebrew-tap
cd homebrew-tap
git init
mkdir Formula
```

Create `Formula/perllsp.rb`:

```ruby
class Perllsp < Formula
  desc "Native Rust language server and debug adapter for Perl"
  homepage "https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp"
  version "0.13.1"
  license any_of: ["MIT", "Apache-2.0"]

  on_macos do
    if Hardware::CPU.arm?
      url "https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/releases/download/v#{version}/perllsp-#{version}-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz"
      sha256 "ACTUAL_SHA256_FROM_RELEASE"
    else
      url "https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/releases/download/v#{version}/perllsp-#{version}-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz"
      sha256 "ACTUAL_SHA256_FROM_RELEASE"
    end
  end

  on_linux do
    if Hardware::CPU.arm?
      url "https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/releases/download/v#{version}/perllsp-#{version}-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz"
      sha256 "ACTUAL_SHA256_FROM_RELEASE"
    else
      url "https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/releases/download/v#{version}/perllsp-#{version}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz"
      sha256 "ACTUAL_SHA256_FROM_RELEASE"
    end
  end

  def install
    extracted_dir = Dir.glob("perllsp-#{version}-*").find { |path| File.directory?(path) }
    raise "expected release archive directory perllsp-#{version}-<target>" unless extracted_dir

    bin.install "#{extracted_dir}/perllsp"
    bin.install "#{extracted_dir}/perl-dap"
  end

  test do
    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/perllsp --version")
    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/perl-dap --version")
  end
end
```

Push the tap:

```bash
git add Formula/perllsp.rb
git commit -m "Add perllsp v0.13.1"
git remote add origin https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/homebrew-tap.git
git push -u origin main
```

Test the formula:

```bash
brew install effortlessmetrics/tap/perllsp
perllsp --version
```

### 7. VS Code Extension (if ready)

If the VS Code extension is ready:

1. Update version in `package.json` to `0.6.0`
2. Update binary download URLs and checksums
3. Build: `npm run compile`
4. Package: `vsce package`
5. Publish: `vsce publish`

### 8. Update Documentation (5 min)

The install surfaces are owned by the documents themselves, not by this
runbook. Do not paste an install section from here — check the owning
documents against the release that just shipped:

| Surface | What to confirm |
| --- | --- |
| [`README.md`](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/blob/main/README.md) Install | Commands still run on the new version |
| [`docs/how-to/INSTALLATION.md`](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/blob/main/docs/how-to/INSTALLATION.md) | Per-platform detail, including the Windows caveats |
| [`docs/tutorials/GETTING_STARTED.md`](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/blob/main/docs/tutorials/GETTING_STARTED.md) | First-run path still matches shipped behavior |

Only change these when the release actually changed installation behavior.
Restating install commands in a fourth place is what produced the drift this
step now guards against.

Windows specifically: publish the manual archive, not the piped
`install.ps1` one-liner, until the publication repo is synced (step 5).

### 9. Announce Release (10 min)

#### GitHub Release Notes

Update the auto-generated release notes with the template below.

Windows note for the operator, not for the notes themselves: announce the
release archive, never the piped `install.ps1` one-liner, until the
publication repo is synced (step 5). The one-liner 404s.
