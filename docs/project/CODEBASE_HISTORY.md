## Executive Summary

perl-lsp began life on **July 17, 2022** as `tree-sitter-perl-better`, a
JavaScript/C tree-sitter grammar for Perl authored by Veesh Goldman. Paul
"LeoNerd" Evans joined in January 2023 and contributed the external scanner
(C) and significant grammar coverage. The project sat in a steady-state
tree-sitter phase through early 2025.

In **July 2025**, Steven Zimmerman forked the tree-sitter grammar, introduced
a Pest (PEG) parser, then rapidly replaced it with a hand-written
recursive-descent parser in pure Rust. Within weeks an LSP server, VSCode
extension, and semantic analyzer were added. A Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP)
server followed in October 2025.

Starting in **January 2026**, the codebase underwent an aggressive
modularization into Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) microcrates,
growing from ~9 crates to **121 crates** by March 2026. All 97 LSP protocol
features reached GA maturity, and the project shipped its v0.10.0 Initial
Public Alpha in late February 2026.

## Phase-by-Phase Evolution

### Phase 1: Tree-sitter Grammar (July 2022 -- July 2025)

**Origin.** The project started as `tree-sitter-perl-better`, a JavaScript-based
tree-sitter grammar with a C external scanner. The very first commit
(2022-07-17) by Veesh Goldman created `grammar.js` with rules for statements,
declarations, subroutines, and phasers.

**Key contributors.**
- **Veesh Goldman** (182 commits): Original author. Grammar foundations,
  numeric parsing, math operators, CI setup.
- **Paul "LeoNerd" Evans** (162 commits across two email aliases): External
  scanner in C for string literals, `qq()` strings, `qw()` lists, heredocs,
  regex. Followed `perly.y` closely. Major grammar expansion.
- Community contributors: Amaan Qureshi, Harald Jorg, Lorenzo Cian, Michael
  Budde, Olaf Alders, Trevor Gross, and others.

**What it covered.** By mid-2025 the tree-sitter grammar handled basic Perl
syntax: variables, operators, control flow, subroutines, packages, regex,
string interpolation, heredocs, and some OOP constructs. The grammar had
~150+ PRs merged over 3 years.

**Limitations.** Tree-sitter grammars are context-free, but Perl parsing is
notoriously context-sensitive (the well-known "only Perl can parse Perl"
problem). The C external scanner grew complex trying to handle string
delimiters, heredocs, and regex vs. division disambiguation. Coverage
plateaued around ~85%.

### Phase 2: Pest Parser (July 16--20, 2025)

**Duration: 4 days.** The Pest (PEG) parser was introduced on 2025-07-16 and
tagged as `v0.1.0-pest` on 2025-07-20.

**What drove it.** Steven Zimmerman joined the project with the goal of building
a full Perl language server. Tree-sitter's context-free grammar could not
adequately handle Perl's context sensitivity. A PEG (Parsing Expression
Grammar) approach via the Pest crate offered:
- Pure Rust (no C dependency)
- Declarative grammar files (`.pest`)
- Rich error messages
- Ordered choice for disambiguation

**What it achieved.** In 4 days, the Pest parser reached coverage of basic Perl
constructs including list literals, command options, and enhanced AST
structure. It handled ~99.995% of edge cases according to the project's own
analysis.

**Why it was superseded.** Despite excellent correctness, PEG backtracking
introduced performance overhead (~200-450 microseconds parse time). The
grammar file approach also limited control over incremental parsing and
error recovery strategies needed for IDE use.

The Pest parser remains in the codebase as `perl-parser-pest`, designated as
a legacy crate. It is maintained but excluded from the default CI gate.

### Phase 3: Native Rust Recursive Descent (July 21, 2025 onward)

**The turning point.** On 2025-07-21, the commit "Implement a modern two-crate
architecture for Perl parsing" created `perl-parser` and `perl-lexer` as the
foundation for the v3 parser: a hand-written recursive-descent parser in pure
Rust.

**Architecture.** The two-crate split (lexer + parser) was deliberate:
- `perl-lexer`: Context-aware tokenizer. Handles the context sensitivity that
  makes Perl hard to parse (regex vs. division, heredoc boundaries, quote-like
  operators with arbitrary delimiters).
- `perl-parser`: Recursive descent parser that consumes the token stream and
  builds a concrete syntax tree.

**Performance.** The native parser achieved 1-150 microseconds parse time with
931 nanosecond incremental updates -- a significant improvement over both the
Pest parser (~200-450 microseconds) and the C tree-sitter parser (~12-68
microseconds for simple cases, but without full coverage).

**Key milestones within this phase:**
- 2025-07-25: Error recovery and incremental parsing infrastructure
- 2025-07-26: First LSP support integration
- 2025-08-03: v0.5.0 with examples for dereferencing, formatting, statement
  modifiers
- 2025-08-11: v0.8.0 with production-hardened position helpers (breaking API)
- 2025-08-22: Official designation as the preferred parser, with Pest marked
  legacy

### Phase 4: LSP Server (July 24, 2025 onward)

**First LSP code.** On 2025-07-24, the commit "Implement incremental parsing,
LSP support, and language bindings for Perl" introduced the initial LSP
infrastructure.

**Rapid feature development.** Within 10 days (July 24 -- August 4, 2025):
- Basic LSP server with JSON-RPC transport
- Code formatting support
- VSCode extension (2025-08-03)
- LSP v2 with modular feature support (2025-08-04)
- Advanced features: Call Hierarchy, Inlay Hints, Test Runner (2025-08-04)
- Code Lens provider (2025-08-04)

**Dedicated crate.** On 2025-08-27, `perl-lsp` was split into its own crate,
separating the server binary from the parser library.

**Feature governance.** The project introduced `features.toml` as the canonical
single source of truth for all LSP capabilities. Each feature tracks:
- LSP specification version
- Maturity level (planned, preview, ga, production)
- Whether it is advertised to clients
- Associated test files

By March 2026, all **97 features** in the catalog reached GA maturity,
achieving 100% LSP 3.18 protocol compliance. The 97 features span:
- 41 text document features (completion, hover, diagnostics, etc.)
- 26 workspace features (symbols, configuration, etc.)
- 10 debug features
- 9 window features
- 9 protocol features
- 2 notebook features

### Phase 5: Debug Adapter Protocol (October 2025)

**Introduction.** The `perl-dap` crate was created on 2025-10-04 with the
commit "test: add comprehensive DAP test scaffolding for Issue #207."

**Architecture.** The DAP implementation uses a dual-mode approach:
- **Native adapter**: Built from scratch in Rust with AST-validated breakpoints,
  step/pause/continue handlers, safe-eval guards, and stdio+socket transport.
- **Bridge adapter**: Maintains compatibility with Perl::LanguageServer for
  interoperability.

**Microcrate decomposition.** The DAP subsystem was later decomposed into 9
focused crates: `perl-dap-breakpoint`, `perl-dap-command-args`, `perl-dap-eval`,
`perl-dap-platform`, `perl-dap-security`, `perl-dap-shell`, `perl-dap-stack`,
`perl-dap-value`, `perl-dap-variables`.

### Phase 6: SRP Microcrate Architecture (January 2026 onward)

**The modularization wave.** Starting 2026-01-16, the codebase underwent
aggressive decomposition following the Single Responsibility Principle. The
growth trajectory:

| Month | Crates created | Running total |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| 2025-07 | 5 | 5 |
| 2025-08 | 3 | 8 |
| 2025-10 | 1 | 9 |
| 2026-01 | 37 | 46 |
| 2026-02 | 38 | 84 |
| 2026-03 | 37 | 121 |

**What drove it.** The project document `AGENTIC_DEV.md` describes the AI-native
development model: high-throughput changes are verified by mechanical gates
rather than manual inspection. Small, focused crates with clear boundaries
make it possible for AI agents and automated tools to:
- Understand scope quickly (each crate has a single responsibility)
- Run targeted tests (no need to rebuild the world)
- Enforce contracts at crate boundaries
- Publish independently on crates.io

**Crate families (March 2026):**

| Family | Count | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `perl-lsp-*` | 41 | LSP feature providers and infrastructure |
| `perl-module-*` | 13 | Module resolution, imports, naming |
| `perl-dap-*` | 9 | Debug adapter components |
| `perl-workspace-*` | 6 | Workspace discovery, indexing, SLOs |
| `perl-ts-*` | 5 | Tree-sitter integration |
| `tree-sitter-*` | 3 | Tree-sitter grammars (JS, C, Rust) |
| Core leaf crates | 44 | Tokens, AST, quote, regex, heredoc, etc. |

**Tiered dependency structure.** Crates are organized in 7 tiers from leaf
crates with zero internal dependencies (Tier 1) up to application binaries
(Tier 6) and legacy crates (Tier 7). This enforces a DAG and prevents
circular dependencies.

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Tree-sitter to Pest: Escaping C

**Decision:** Replace the JavaScript/C tree-sitter grammar with a Pest PEG
grammar in pure Rust.

**Rationale:**
- Tree-sitter's C external scanner was becoming hard to maintain
- The context-free grammar could not handle Perl's context sensitivity
- C code introduced memory safety concerns
- Pest offered a declarative, pure-Rust alternative

**Outcome:** Achieved in 4 days (2025-07-16 to 2025-07-20). Demonstrated that
a Rust-native approach was viable for Perl parsing.

### 2. Pest to Recursive Descent: Performance for IDE Use

**Decision:** Replace the Pest PEG parser with a hand-written recursive-descent
parser.

**Rationale:**
- PEG backtracking caused ~200-450 microsecond parse times
- IDE use requires sub-millisecond incremental parsing
- Hand-written parsers offer full control over error recovery
- Incremental parsing is easier to implement with explicit state management

**Outcome:** Parse times dropped to 1-150 microseconds with 931-nanosecond
incremental updates. The parser achieved ~100% Perl 5 syntax coverage.

### 3. Dual Indexing (PR #122 pattern)

**Decision:** Index workspace symbols under both qualified and bare forms.

**Rationale:** Users navigate code using both `Foo::Bar::method` (qualified)
and `method` (bare). Indexing under both forms provides instant lookups
regardless of how the user references a symbol.

**Implementation:**
```rust
// Index under bare name
file_index.references.entry(bare_name.to_string())
    .or_default().push(symbol_ref.clone());
// Index under qualified name
file_index.references.entry(qualified)
    .or_default().push(symbol_ref);
```

### 4. Feature Governance Subsystem

**Decision:** Implement a formal feature governance system with 9 dedicated
microcrates.

**Rationale:** With 97 LSP features, the project needed:
- Compile-time feature IDs (`perl-lsp-feature-ids`)
- Feature flag evaluation (`perl-lsp-feature-flags`)
- Policy enforcement (`perl-lsp-feature-policy`)
- Runtime profiles (`perl-lsp-feature-profile`)
- Governance contracts (`perl-lsp-feature-governance`)

**Outcome:** Features can be individually toggled, profiled, and governed. The
CLI exposes feature profiles via `perl-lsp-feature-profile-cli`.

### 5. No-unwrap / No-panic Coding Standard

**Decision:** Ban `unwrap()`, `expect()`, `panic!()`, `todo!()`,
`unimplemented!()`, `dbg!()`, and `std::process::abort()` from production
code.

**Introduced:** January 25, 2026, with a series of commits eliminating
hundreds of `unwrap`/`expect` calls across the codebase.

**Rationale:** A language server must never crash. Every code path must degrade
gracefully. The project uses:
- `?` operator and `Result`/`Option` propagation
- `.ok_or_else()` for explicit error conversion
- `Option<Regex>` with `.ok()` for graceful regex compilation failure
- `perl-tdd-support::must`/`must_some` helpers in tests
- Safety ratchets in CI: baseline counts of `unwrap=0`, `panic!=0`, `unsafe=0`

**Exception:** One centralized `#[allow(clippy::expect_used)]` for
`lsp_types::Uri` fallback in `crates/perl-lsp-rs/src/util/uri.rs`.

### 6. SRP Microcrate Architecture

**Decision:** Decompose the codebase into 121+ single-responsibility crates.

**Rationale:**
- AI-native development requires small, well-bounded units of code
- Compile-time enforcement of module boundaries
- Independent crates.io publishing
- Targeted testing (run only affected crate tests)
- Reduced rebuild times during development

**Trade-offs acknowledged:** More `Cargo.toml` files to manage, more complex
dependency graph, potential for over-decomposition. Mitigated by the tiered
dependency structure and automated tooling.

### 7. Supply Chain Security

**Decision:** Implement comprehensive supply chain security measures.

**Introduced:** 2026-01-28 with the PR "feat(security): Add Supply Chain
Security - SBOM & SLSA Provenance (#281)."

**Components:**
- **SBOM generation** in both SPDX and CycloneDX formats
- **cargo-deny** (`deny.toml`) for license, advisory, and source auditing
- **SLSA provenance** attestations on release artifacts
- **Dependabot** for automated dependency updates (48 bot commits)
- **Security scanning** CI workflow (`ci-security.yml`)
- **Path traversal and injection hardening** across LSP and DAP servers

## Interesting Facts and Statistics

1. **4 days from Pest to Legacy.** The Pest parser was introduced, reached
   v0.1.0, and was already being superseded within 4 days (July 16--20, 2025).

2. **Tree-sitter heritage preserved.** The original tree-sitter grammar
   remains in the repository as `tree-sitter-perl/` with its test corpus of
   32 corpus files used for regression testing. The test corpus has grown to
   73 `.pl` files.

3. **Paul "LeoNerd" Evans connection.** Paul Evans, who wrote the C external
   scanner and major grammar portions, is the author of numerous CPAN modules
   and a Perl core contributor. His `perly.y`-following approach grounded the
   grammar in Perl's actual parser.

4. **The project name evolved.** `tree-sitter-perl-better` (2022) became the
   foundation for what is now `perl-lsp` (2025), reflecting the shift from
   a grammar project to a full language server.

5. **121 crates, one workspace.** The workspace has more crates than some
   organizations have repositories. Each crate averages ~3,000 lines of Rust
   code.

6. **Zero unsafe, zero panics.** The production code maintains baseline
   counts of `unwrap/expect=0`, `panic!/todo!/unimplemented!/unreachable!=0`,
   and `unsafe=0`, enforced by CI ratchets.

7. **Sub-microsecond incremental parsing.** At 931 nanoseconds for incremental
   updates, the parser can re-parse between every keystroke without any
   perceptible delay.

8. **AI-native by design.** With ~231 commits from Google Jules and the
   explicit AI-native development model documentation, this is one of the
   most openly AI-assisted Rust projects in the ecosystem.

9. **97 LSP features at GA.** The project implements every feature in the
   LSP 3.18 specification that it advertises, from basic completion and
   hover to notebook support, pull diagnostics, and type hierarchy.

10. **Rust Edition 2024.** The project uses the newest Rust edition (2024) with
    MSRV 1.95, adopting the latest language features.

11. **The commit velocity chart is a hockey stick.** From ~5 commits/month in
    2024 to ~569 commits/month in early 2026 -- a 100x increase.

12. **13 CI workflows.** From basic CI (`ci.yml`, 2023) to a full release
    orchestration pipeline including nightly builds, security scanning,
    Docker publishing, crate publishing, extension publishing, and package
    manager bumps across Homebrew, Scoop, and Chocolatey.
