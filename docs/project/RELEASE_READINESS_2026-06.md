# Release-Readiness Bundle - 2026-06 Campaign

> **Historical snapshot — not current release-readiness authority.** This June bundle is retained for audit provenance and is superseded by the [v0.18 release scope](../releases/v0.18.0-scope.json) and the [current release status](status/release.md). Do not infer current readiness, merge authorization, tagging, publishing, or dispatch from this file.

**Status**: historical, superseded by the v0.18 release-train authority. The dispatch hold and CPAN qualification below remain historical decisions; do not tag, publish, or dispatch a release without Steven's explicit approval.
**Snapshot captured**: 2026-06-22
**Release payload SHA at snapshot**: `b6785e4af8af3290d4a0dcdcc1ad31b7a57f8f12`
**`origin/main` SHA at snapshot**: `b6785e4af8af3290d4a0dcdcc1ad31b7a57f8f12`
**Previous readiness bundle merge SHA**: `bf4217b2073a11522db771ff5923895d935ac6d9`
**Workspace version (`Cargo.toml`)**: `0.16.0`
**Last release tag**: `v0.16.0` at `b6d9f12b995ad8ad78ca641940bd73e4b1a3c26d` (2026-06-06)

Note: the release payload SHA is the latest audited merged main commit at this historical refresh. The historical payload includes the earlier closeout through #2047. It also includes the post-#2047 delta through #2606: strict/warnings fixAll dedupe (#2058), missing-pragma severity alignment (#2061), printf `%*` / `%.*` diagnostic false-positive repair (#1868), package-rename fallback safety (#2070), completion quieting in heredoc/POD/string/regex contexts (#1821, #2573, #1808, #1813), DAP transport honesty and supervision (#1790, #1809), DAP conditional-breakpoint and PR-smoke receipts (#1843, PR #2590 / merge `52280ee9a9844d7de24427da18eae842653f5fcd`), shared Perl toolchain/default-DAP interpreter completion (#2026), native formatter `.perltidyrc` consumption fix (#2025), state-variable semantic-token fact-class cutover (#2030), semantic SNAPSHOT/oracle/HIR substrate (#2569, #2570, #2571), spec/corpus-doc corrections (#2597, #2598), DAP test-helper feature gating (#2596), and truthful pending-parse indexing metrics (#2606). At that time, the release-staging refresh branch still needed its merge-blocking checks before this bundle could be treated as a release-stage artifact.

Note: `v0.16.0` is a real tag, but it was not on the `origin/main` ancestry observed at this snapshot (`git describe origin/main` resolved from `v0.15.0`). Do not use a naive "commits since v0.16.0" count as release evidence without resolving that tag-lineage question against live history.

## Release Verdict

| Area | Verdict | Evidence |
|------|---------|----------|
| P0 blockers | PASS | No open P0 surfaced by this closeout pass. |
| P1 blockers | PASS with caveats | The measured multi-root `workspace/symbol` P1 is closed by #1522 and the focused smoke is green. Fresh merged-PR required-gate aggregates are green through #2606 on release payload `b6785e4af8af3290d4a0dcdcc1ad31b7a57f8f12`; #2596 also passed a 41/0 CI-check rollup before merge. Full CPAN-scale parser accuracy remains caveated because the full ratchet is still runner-dark. |
| Release dispatch | HELD | This bundle stages the release decision only. No tag, publish, marketplace upload, crates.io publish, Docker image, or GitHub Release is authorized here. |

## Gate State

Latest audited `origin/main` payload at refresh: [#2606](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/2606), head commit `66a61f033a3b58eb48432aea59e86dcd4e1840e5`, merge commit `b6785e4af8af3290d4a0dcdcc1ad31b7a57f8f12`, merged 2026-06-22T05:31:59Z with 34/0 GitHub checks passing. The previous readiness bundle was PR [#2059](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/2059), closing issue [#2057](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/issues/2057), merge commit `bf4217b2073a11522db771ff5923895d935ac6d9`; it refreshed the bundle through `88528f16320a0598387ee68632467ee0b3053419` and superseded [#2050](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/2050). Post-#2047 payload now included here covers strict/warnings fixAll and diagnostic-severity repairs, package-rename fallback safety, completion quieting in strings/regex/heredoc/POD, DAP transport honesty/supervision/conditional-breakpoint receipts, shared Perl toolchain completion in DAP, native formatter profile consumption, semantic-token `state` declaration fact-class cutover, semantic SNAPSHOT/oracle/HIR substrate, corpus/spec documentation corrections, DAP test-helper feature gating, and pending-parse metric saturation.

Post-#1894 merged payload included in this bundle: [#1890](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1890), [#1891](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1891), [#1893](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1893), [#1895](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1895), [#1896](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1896), [#1898](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1898), [#1925](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1925), [#1932](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1932), [#1938](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1938), [#1926](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1926), [#1927](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1927), [#1939](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1939), [#1945](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1945), [#1946](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1946), [#1948](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1948), [#1949](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1949), [#1950](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1950), [#1951](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1951), [#1957](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1957), [#1845](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1845), [#1899](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1899), [#1900](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1900), [#1907](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1907), [#1909](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1909), [#1920](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1920), [#1928](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1928), [#1978](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1978), [#2016](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/2016), [#2038](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/2038), [#2039](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/2039), [#2041](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/2041), [#1838](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1838), [#1841](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1841), [#1834](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1834), [#1571](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1571), [#2045](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/2045), [#2046](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/2046), [#2050](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/2050), and [#2047](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/2047). Direct main commits tied to issues #1962, #2051, and #2052 are also included in this refreshed payload. Release claims below remain limited to the receipts in this file.

The earlier #1759 stale-branch PR-fast caveat is superseded for release-gate purposes by #1894's fresh `PR Smoke (Fast Feedback)` and `CI Gate (Merge-Blocking)` passes on payload `89a1225e48852583f6662da43257dae6a651a96b`, plus fresh #1926, #1939, #1945, #1946, #2039, #2041, #1571, #2045, #2047, #2596, and #2606 required-gate passes on the closeout payload. #2046 and #2050 were docs-only readiness refreshes: their product lanes were intentionally skipped by the docs/assets guard while coverage, workflow-trigger, routed Rust Small, RIPR, and advisory gates passed. The targeted prior-current DAP stack-trace receipt remains listed below as supporting evidence for the original stale-branch diagnosis. This release-staging branch is the required branch-gate receipt for refreshing this bundle through `b6785e4af8af3290d4a0dcdcc1ad31b7a57f8f12`.

| Required / decision gate | Status | Notes |
|--------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| `Perl LSP Rust Small Result` | PASS | #2606 merged after a 34/0 GitHub-check rollup; #2596 merged after a 41/0 rollup. Earlier release-scope aggregates remain recorded for #2047/#2045. |
| `ripr+ New Gap Gate` | PASS | #2606 and #2596 rollups passed with no failed required checks; earlier closeout `ripr+` aggregate was green on #2047. |
| `Codecov / Patch 95` | PASS | #2606 and #2596 required check rollups passed; #2047 Patch-95 completed 2026-06-21T02:32:24Z and Codecov patch completed 2026-06-21T02:32:28Z. |
| `Workflow Trigger Lint` | PASS | #2606 and #2596 rollups passed; #2046 GitHub check completed 2026-06-21T00:26:54Z and #2045 completed 2026-06-21T00:08:33Z. |
| `PR Smoke (Fast Feedback)` | PASS | #2606 and #2596 rollups passed; #2047 product/test payload completed 2026-06-21T02:42:18Z. |
| `CI Gate (Merge-Blocking)` | PASS | #2606 and #2596 rollups passed; #2047 aggregate completed 2026-06-21T02:42:23Z after all required shards passed. |
| `UX Regression Tests` | PASS | #2047 UX lane completed 2026-06-21T02:23:01Z. |
| `droid-review` | PASS | #2047 advisory check completed 2026-06-21T02:20:40Z. |
| `LSP Memory Smoke` | PASS | #2047 memory-smoke lane completed 2026-06-21T02:21:18Z. |
| `UB Review Advisory on GitHub Hosted` | PASS | #2047 advisory check completed 2026-06-21T02:39:46Z. Advisory proof, not product-smoke proof. |

Advisory/non-required state observed during the #2045/#2046/#2050/#2047 closeout refresh: #2045 initially failed `Perl LSP Rust Small on CX43` because the disk preflight routed to fallback, and the aggregate passed after the disk-full fallback succeeded. #2046 and #2050 skipped product lanes under the docs/assets-only guard while required trigger, coverage, routed Rust Small, RIPR, and advisory checks passed. Required product/test merge gates were green on #2045, #2047, #2596, and #2606; required docs-scope merge gates were green on #2046/#2050. This branch carries the current refreshed-bundle gate before merge.

Coverage semantics after #1482/#1549/#1576/#1581/#1586: coverage verdicts are scoped to coverage shortfall/setup/routing failures. Routed test failures belong to test-named gates, not the Codecov/Patch-95 verdict.

Runner semantics after #1528: self-hosted disk preflight can fail over to GitHub-hosted only for disk-preflight failures. Real test or quality-gate failures are not masked by fallback.

Required workflow trigger semantics after #1816/#1817: required CI workflows stay trigger-visible for PR events. Docs/assets-only PRs skip expensive Rust jobs inside the workflow guard rather than by `paths-ignore`, so Workflow Trigger Lint remains enforced.

## Shipping Scope Since The Prior Draft

This table records the late closeout scope that updates the older 2026-06 draft. The changelog PR [#1419](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/1419) is merged and carries the user-facing release-note wording.

| Theme | Merged PRs | Release claim |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| Parser and quick-fix robustness | #1457, #1460, #1461, #1463, #1481, #1483, #1893, #1913, #1845 | More valid Perl and malformed mid-edit input stays quiet; `given` blocks accept postfix `when`/`default` modifiers and ordinary statements; UTF-8 mid-codepoint code-action ranges no longer panic; duplicate quick-fix lightbulb entries from overlapping providers are collapsed; `my sub`/`our sub`/`state sub` declarations retain their declarator facts for downstream semantic analysis. |
| Single-root LSP readiness | #1551 | Baseline PR smoke blockers were repaired: hover preservation, workspace file-op/index waits, empty workspace-folder no-op handling, progress harness determinism. |
| Multi-root project model | #1522, #2606 | `workspace/symbol` waits for active indexing, includes `workspaceFolderUri`, and returns deterministic multi-root results. Pending-parse indexing metrics now saturate at zero after duplicate/out-of-order parse-complete notifications instead of wrapping to `usize::MAX`. |
| Semantic identity and compiler substrate | #1876, #1904, #1891, #1902, #1900, #1895, #1896, #1599, #1910, #1920 | File-scoped semantic fact IDs include `FileId`, preventing identical source in different files from colliding in anchors, entities, occurrences, and file-scoped edges while preserving the file-neutral reference-source sentinel. `FileSemanticBundle` category hashes now include generated-member and eval-sub synthetic entities/anchors before hash computation, and shards carry an explicit producer schema version. AST child-classification flags now match traversal, HIR lowers control-flow shells, PIR v0 tooling IR is available from HIR, compile-state layers and semantic snapshot identity invariants have durable docs/proof, provider-decision schema alignment is restored, parser boundary-detection responsibilities are documented for consumers, and `our` declarations have scoped semantic-token fact classes. |
| Diagnostics accuracy | #1562, #1868, #2061 | `$self->{name}` / `$ref->{key}` no longer produce false `UnquotedBareword` diagnostics under `use strict`; valid printf dynamic width/precision specifiers (`%*`, `%.*`) stay quiet; missing `use strict` / `use warnings` diagnostics now match the catalog's Warning severity. |
| Safe edits and code actions | #1481, #1913, #2058, #2070 | Code-action UTF-8 mid-codepoint ranges return no action instead of panicking; duplicate lightbulb actions are collapsed; `source.fixAll` deduplicates strict/warnings pragma inserts while preserving source-aware insertion points; package-scoped rename now refuses unsafe same-file fallback edits when workspace/index facts are incomplete. |
| References, docs links, hover, and folding | #1597, #1638, #1560, #1795, #1882, #1840, #1834, #1962, #2052 | Partial-index reference fallback avoids documents-lock re-entry; perldoc/MetaCPAN targets share one validated resolver; POD `L<>` document links are exposed and resolved, including virtual perldoc section targets; non-standard `=head1` sections such as ARGUMENTS, RETURN VALUES, EXAMPLES, and SEE ALSO are extracted; cached POD hover content refreshes after external module-file edits; user-supplied hover documentation escapes markdown metacharacters; heredoc/multiline folding boundaries are corrected. |
| DAP honesty | #1430, #1444, #1496, #1498, #1806, #1810, #1759, #1811, #1807, #1790, #1809, #1843 | Variable-reference spaces are typed; evaluate and stack parsing report the real invalid input instead of stale or misleading state; request ordering now rejects out-of-sequence initialize/launch/configurationDone flows; scope and variable responses expose DAP pagination hint fields; capability flags match routed restart-frame, step-in-targets, and terminate-threads handlers; non-request DAP messages are explicitly accepted/logged; persistent event-write failure shuts the transport down instead of losing events silently. Conditional-breakpoint behavior has a real debugger receipt. Logpoint message interpolation is available in the breakpoint-store substrate when callers supply variable maps; end-to-end process-layer variable extraction remains deferred. |
| Transport robustness | #1793 | `Content-Length` frame parsing uses checked arithmetic for `body_start` and recovers through the existing invalid-length path on overflow. |
| Deterministic completion value | #1532, #1573, #1579, #1585, #1875, #1839, #1889, #1926, #1945, #1949, #1838, #1841, #1808, #1813, #1821, #2573 | Try::Tiny, Mojolicious, Dancer, DBI, inherited package-qualified methods, and indexed package receiver completions are offered only with supporting evidence; context-specific completion families keep stable semantic sort tiers; quoted special-character hash keys are surfaced in hash-key completion; completion items serialize `filterText` and advertise LSP 3.17 insert-text modes; multiline inline-completion candidates are full-document parse-checked and fail closed when ranges cannot be reconstructed. General completions stay quiet inside strings, regex patterns, heredoc bodies, and POD while preserving path/import-specific contexts; heredoc left-shift classification now rejects arrow-method and constant-shift false heredocs. Test::More and Test2::V0 assertion packs now have completion-pack contract fixtures for positive and quiet contexts. |
| Formatting and workspace configuration | #1899, #2016, #2025, #1951, #1978, #2026 | The server discovers project-local `.perltidyrc` settings when no explicit formatter profile is configured, feeds supported profile options into the native formatter, and resolves Perl interpreter identity through a shared cached toolchain profile. DAP launch defaults now use that same toolchain profile when `launch.json` omits an explicit Perl path. |
| Easy first-run extension path | #1867, #1898, #1571, #2047 | VSIX packaging/install smoke is storage-safe and restart-safe; VS Code now has bounded include-path discovery suggestions, optional server-gated AI completion discoverability, and a bundled demo project command; `perllsp --doctor [dir]` prints a read-only setup report with actionable Perl/config/include-root guidance; PL701 missing-module suggestions now point users at doctor and setup documentation. |
| Measurement and compatibility substrate | #1482, #1520, #1528, #1530, #1539, #1549, #1576, #1581, #1586, #1688, #1689, #1816, #1817, #1833, #1878, #1881, #1886, #1842, #1903, #1894, #1890, #1932, #1938, #1939, #1950, #1957, #1959, #2038, #2039, #2041, #2045, #2051, #2062, #2065, #2067, #2068, #2069, #2569, #2570, #2571, #2596, #2597, #2598 | Coverage/test semantics, CPAN bounded ratchet mode, runner disk failover, workflow privilege analysis, routed-suite expectations, draft-ripr neutrality, trigger-safe docs/assets-only CI skipping, Windows-worktree coverage-baseline recovery, native-tooling git-context recovery, RIPR evidence git-context recovery, self-hosted workspace-target cleanup, sigil-aware completion regression coverage, gold-fixture corpus hygiene, the #1839 fmt/Patch-95 gate repair, PR-summary coverage tests, Rust 1.95 toolchain documentation and CI pins, duplicate hash-key test-name repair, gate-list CLI contract coverage, active-manifest/allocation-tracker coverage receipts, agent-lease and agent-ledger proof-control-plane coverage, PR-fast capability snapshot repair, main fmt drift repair, completion-pack quiet receipts, async-readiness test hardening, semantic SNAPSHOT/oracle/HIR substrate, DAP test-helper feature gating, and corpus/spec doc corrections are current. |

Correction from earlier draft: #1524 is closed, not merged. The arrow-deref diagnostic fix landed as #1562.

## Product Smoke Receipts

All product-smoke commands below were run locally on Windows against `origin/main`/`c94d50e8` lineage during the 2026-06-20 closeout pass unless noted. Later main commits through release payload `b6785e4af8af3290d4a0dcdcc1ad31b7a57f8f12` are covered by their PR-level receipts and GitHub gates rather than by a full local product-smoke rerun after every merge. The post-smoke delta includes docs/CI release-staging changes, POD/documentation link fixes, formatter/toolchain/profile fixes, completion quieting, DAP transport/test receipts, rename/code-action/diagnostic repairs, semantic-token/compiler-substrate work, DAP test-helper gating, and pending-parse metric saturation. Cargo target output for the local smoke receipts was redirected outside the worktree under `D:\cargo-target\perl-lsp-release-smoke*`, the repo safe target wrapper's external cache, or the specific external target dir named in the command.

## CPAN Ratchet Status

| Mode | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Bounded representative subset | PASS | Workflow run [27931852439](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/actions/runs/27931852439), head `b6785e4`, completed success 2026-06-22T05:43:34Z. Receipt `bounded-sweep.json`: 75 roots, 4,172 files, 4,130 clean, 36 with parser errors, 0 catastrophic, 116 error nodes, elapsed 1.86s. |
| Full CPAN ratchet | UNKNOWN / CAVEATED | Latest inspected full run [27899664867](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/actions/runs/27899664867), head `89b1841c`, failed 2026-06-21T09:31:40Z with runner shutdown/exit 143 during batch 10 after batch 9 timed out. The previous scheduled full run [27866329744](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/actions/runs/27866329744) failed the same way on 2026-06-20. Do not claim CPAN-scale accuracy from this bundle. |

Release wording may say "bounded CPAN top-50 profile passed" with the counts above. It must not say "CPAN-scale accuracy passed" until the full ratchet has a fresh successful receipt.

## Known Deferred Work

| Item | State | Release handling |
|------|-------|------------------|
| [#991](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/991) DAP trust lane | OPEN | Deferred; not required for this staged release because the focused DAP honesty matrix above is green. |
| [#676](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp-swarm/pull/676) fuzz/config expansion | OPEN | Deferred; not part of this release gate. |
| Full CPAN ratchet | Dark/caveated | Requires restored full-run receipt or explicit release caveat. |
| DAP logpoint process-layer variable extraction | Deferred | #1807 adds interpolation substrate and tests, but end-to-end logpoint substitution still requires the debug adapter/process layer to pass frame variable maps. No release claim is made for full editor-visible logpoint substitution. |
| Broad feature waves / dependabot | Open queue | Deferred by release-closeout scope. |

## Explicit Non-Goal

This document does not authorize or initiate a release. No tag, no `crates.io` publish, no VS Code Marketplace upload, no Docker image, and no GitHub Release will be created until Steven explicitly approves and dispatches the release workflow.
