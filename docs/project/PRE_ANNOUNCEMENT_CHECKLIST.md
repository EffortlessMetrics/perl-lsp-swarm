## Summary Dashboard

Quick snapshot at **2026-04-08** against v0.13.0 (workspace currently at v0.12.2):

| Section | ✓ Done | ⚠ In Progress | ✗ Blocker |
|---------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| 1. Build & Publish | 7 | 3 | 7 |
| 2. Quality Gates | 3 | 4 | 0 |
| 3. Documentation | 11 | 0 | 3 |
| 4. Marketplace | 2 | 1 | 2 |
| 5. Community | 2 | 1 | 2 |
| 6. Announcement Content | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| 7. Operational | 3 | 3 | 0 |
| **Total** | **30** | **14** | **15** |

*Baseline at 2026-04-07: 16 done / 11 in-progress / 17 blockers. Session (2026-04-08) added 14 new ✓ items, net reduced blockers by 2 (17 → 15), added in-progress tracking for UX P0 PRs still open.*

### Hard blockers before announcement

1. **Demo GIFs / screenshots** (USER ACTION REQUIRED) — #3302: 3 P0 GIFs must be recorded before VSCode Marketplace listing or announcement posts. Recording guide: `scripts/marketing/render-walkthrough-gif.py`. Source files: `demo_workspace/`.
2. **v0.12.2 publish to complete** — watch retrigger aabddeabc5; do not version-bump until confirmed live.
3. **4 UX P0 PRs to merge** — #3306, #3308, #3309, #3312 are open and in review.
4. **Version bump to v0.13.0** — `gh workflow run version-bump.yml --field version=0.13.0`. Unblocks all "pending version bump" items.
5. **CHANGELOG.md dated v0.13.0 entry** — automated by `version-bump.yml`.
6. **Release workflow** — `gh workflow run release-orchestration.yml --field version=0.13.0 ...` — publishes crates, extension, Docker, creates GitHub Release.
7. **Post-publish smoke** — run 5-project smoke protocol from `docs/project/PUBLISHING_ROADMAP.md` Part 2.

### Announcement content (USER ACTION REQUIRED)

- **Record demo GIFs** — see #3302 for full spec (P0 required before Marketplace goes live)
- **Finalize announcement copy** — drafts in `docs/articles/drafts/`; update to reflect 2026-04-08 session deliverables before posting
- **Write social posts** — outlines in `PUBLISHING_ROADMAP.md §3.6`; finalize as `docs/project/ANNOUNCEMENT_POSTS.md`

### Path to green

```bash
# Prerequisites (wait for these):
# - v0.12.2 publish retrigger completes (watch aabddeabc5)
