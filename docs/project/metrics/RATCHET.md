# Scorecard Floor-Metric Ratchet — Operational Guide

> **Audience**: contributors and CI operators.
> **What this is**: the operational layer on top of the conceptual scorecard
> framework in [README.md](README.md).  It answers the practical questions:
> how do you run a ratchet check, how do you promote a baseline, and where
> does the CI enforcement live?
>
> For the *why* and the four-layer model rationale, read [README.md](README.md)
> and tracking issue [#4105](https://github.com/effortlessmetrics/perl-lsp/issues/4105).

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Check that all committed baselines pass (bootstrap-safe: passes if no receipt)
just ci-metrics-ratchet

# Check a single subsystem
just ci-metrics-ratchet-check parser

# Promote a metric from improvement → floor (after stable-wins threshold)
cargo xtask metrics promote-baseline parser

# Ratchet parser baseline up after a confirmed improvement
# (edit .ci/metrics/baselines/parser.json, run just ci-metrics-ratchet, commit)
```

## Four-Layer Model (Summary)

Full rationale is in [README.md](README.md).  The operational summary:

| Layer | What it means | Who touches it |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| **1. One JSON file per subsystem** | `.ci/metrics/baselines/<subsystem>.json` is the committed truth | CI + maintainer |
| **2. Floor vs improvement split** | `floor_metrics` block a merge; `improvement_metrics` are informational | Baseline author |
| **3. Ratchet only on stable wins** | Don't raise the floor after one lucky run — require `STABLE_WIN_THRESHOLD` consecutive improvements | `cargo xtask metrics promote-baseline` |
| **4. Issue ↔ scorecard linkage** | Every open issue states which scorecard metric it improves | Issue author |

---

## Committed Baselines

Baselines live at `.ci/metrics/baselines/<subsystem>.json`.  The schema is
defined in `xtask/src/tasks/metrics/ratchet.rs` (`SubsystemBaseline`):

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "measured_at": "2026-04-24T00:00:00Z",
  "subsystem": "parser",
  "commit": "522c47f",
  "floor_metrics": {
    "system_clean_rate": 0.944816,
    "system_crash_count": 0,
    "cpan_clean_rate": 0.952945,
    "strict_clean_subset_pass_rate": 1.0
  },
  "improvement_metrics": {
    "recovery_salvage_rate": 0.204545,
    "error_density_per_1k_loc": 1.95,
    "node_kind_coverage": 0.942029
  },
  "tolerance_pct": 0.005
}
```

### Active subsystems

| File | Subsystem | Floor gate |
|------|-----------|------------|
| `.ci/metrics/baselines/parser.json` | Parser corpus cleanliness | `system_clean_rate`, `cpan_clean_rate`, `system_crash_count`, `strict_clean_subset_pass_rate` |
| `.ci/metrics/baselines/engineering_health.json` | Build/test hygiene | `strict_clean_subset_pass_rate` |
| `.ci/metrics/baselines/memory_plateau.json` | Memory plateau scorecard | See file |
| `.ci/metrics/baselines/parser_accuracy.json` | Span / AST correctness | See file |
| `.ci/metrics/baselines/parser_accuracy_gold.json` | Gold parser accuracy corpus | See file |
| `.ci/metrics/baselines/token.json` | Lexer token health | See file |
| `.ci/metrics/baselines/editor_ux.json` | Editor UX scorecard | See file |

## Metric Direction Convention

The ratchet determines regression direction from the metric name:

| Suffix | Direction | Regression = |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| `_count`, `_nodes`, `_unreadable` | **Lower is better** | current > baseline × (1 + tolerance) |
| anything else | **Higher is better** | current < baseline × (1 − tolerance) |
| listed in `lower_is_better` array | **Lower is better** | same as `_count` |

Tolerance default is `0.005` (0.5 %).  Each baseline can override via
`"tolerance_pct": <value>`.

## Running the Ratchet Locally

```bash
# Check both committed subsystems (bootstrap-safe)
just ci-metrics-ratchet

# Single subsystem
just ci-metrics-ratchet-check parser
```

**Bootstrap mode**: when no receipt exists at
`target/receipts/metrics/<subsystem>.json`, the xtask falls back to the
committed baseline values.  This means the check always passes until a sweep
generates a fresh receipt.  This is intentional — infrastructure validation
before measurement instrumentation.

**With a fresh receipt**: after running the parser sweep the xtask reads the
receipt and compares against the baseline.  Any floor-metric regression causes
a non-zero exit.

---

## CI Integration

### Nightly gate (`ci-nightly.yml`)

A dedicated `scorecard-ratchet-check` job runs the committed scorecard floor
checks:

- **Trigger**: nightly schedule, `workflow_dispatch`, or `ci:metrics-ratchet`
  label on a PR.
- **Effect**: non-zero exit on any floor-metric regression.  If a subsystem has
  no fresh receipt in `target/receipts/metrics/`, the check uses baseline values
  as current values and reports bootstrap mode.
- **Bootstrap safety**: job passes if no receipt exists (see above).

### Merge gate (`ci-gate`)

`just ci-metrics-ratchet` is NOT currently in `ci-gate` (merge-blocking).
The nightly job is the enforcement point for v1.  Rationale: receipts are
generated by the full corpus sweep which is too slow for every PR.  Once
a per-PR parser-smoke step emits a lightweight receipt, `ci-gate` can include
a ratchet check against a smoke-subset baseline.

---

## Promoting a Baseline

Use `promote-baseline` to raise a floor after confirming stable improvement:

```bash
# 1.  Check which improvement metrics are stable (≥3 consecutive runs, +1%)
cargo xtask metrics promote-baseline parser

# 2.  If candidates are listed, edit .ci/metrics/baselines/parser.json:
#     - Move the metric from improvement_metrics to floor_metrics (or raise the floor value)
#     - Update measured_at and commit fields

# 3.  Verify the promoted baseline still passes
just ci-metrics-ratchet

# 4.  Commit the updated baseline as a standalone PR titled:
#     "chore(ratchet): promote parser <metric> floor to <value>"
```

The stable-wins state is written to `target/metrics/stable_wins/<subsystem>.json`
by `cargo xtask metrics ratchet-check <subsystem> --record`.  The nightly CI
job does not record stable-wins state yet; use `--record` during an intentional
baseline-promotion run after collecting fresh receipts.

---

## Adding a New Subsystem

1. Create `.ci/metrics/baselines/<subsystem>.json` following the schema above.
   Set `improvement_metrics` fields to `null` until you have a measurement.
2. Add `cargo run -p xtask -- metrics ratchet-check <subsystem>` to
   `just ci-metrics-ratchet` in the justfile.
3. Add the subsystem to the active subsystems table in this document.
4. Open a follow-up issue linking the subsystem to its improvement metrics.

---

## Issue ↔ Scorecard Linkage

Every open issue that changes parser or engineering-health behavior should
include a line:

> **Scorecard impact**: improves `parser` → `<metric>` from `<baseline>` toward `<target>`.

This creates an auditable chain from "work merged" to "floor moved".  See
[README.md §Layer 4](README.md) for the full issue-family → scorecard mapping.
