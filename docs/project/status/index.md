# perl-lsp Status Overview

> Human-owned. Edit this file to update release narrative and project state.

## What's True Right Now

- **Release posture**: `v0.17.0` is the current workspace version and shipped public-beta release (2026-06-28); `v0.18.0` is the next public-beta train, not a maturity promotion or version bump in this tree. The published crate surface is 33 crates. See [release.md](release.md) for channel receipts.
- **Status discipline**: this file is for narrative, subsystem files are for evidence, and `just status-update` plus `just status-check` are the anti-drift workflow
- **LSP server**: `features.toml` is the canonical capability catalog; 60 user-visible features at 100% coverage (125/125 including plumbing protocol methods and DAP handlers) — see generated [lsp.md](lsp.md) for current numbers
- **Test infrastructure**: `nix develop -c just ci-gate` is the canonical merge receipt and `cargo xtask ignored-tests` is the tracked-test-debt source
- **Parser stack**: the default parser path is the native recursive-descent stack backed by the Rust lexer and parser-core crates, with three named coverage lanes: Ubuntu system Perl as the compatibility baseline, CPAN top 1000 as the ecosystem-breadth baseline, and the repo-owned corpus as the deterministic regression baseline
- **Refactoring engine**: inline and move-code flows exist; broader refactoring hardening is still roadmap work
- **Safety ratchets**: production baseline currently at `unwrap/expect=0`, panic-family macros (`panic!/todo!/unimplemented!/unreachable!`) = `0`, explicit `unsafe` syntax = `0`
- **Security**: hardening exists for path traversal, command injection, DAP evaluate, and perldoc/perlcritic argument injection

## What's Next

**Now (active milestone: v0.17.0 shipped public beta)**
- `v0.17.0` shipped: unified LSP/DAP Perl toolchain profile, automatic `.perltidyrc` discovery, first-run `--doctor` report, workspace method signature help, framework-aware inline completions, quality hardening
- Keep public-beta wording consistent: package versions use normal SemVer, but the product posture is not stable/GA
- Keep the three parser verification lanes explicit and green: `just corpus-sweep-check`, `just cpan-corpus-check`, and `just parser-audit`, with `just common-corpus-check` covering the pinned strict-clean subset
- Keep the top-level README, status docs, and release runbooks aligned with the actual `perllsp` asset line, the `perl-lsp-rs` extension package, and the 33-crate published surface
- Keep Homebrew, GitHub release assets, VS Code Marketplace, and Open VSX install receipts explicit in the release closeout
- Verify the existing `v0.17.0` release receipt and close the remaining channel receipts; do not dispatch release orchestration for an already-shipped train

**Next (v0.18.0 public-beta train)**
- Keep all three parser corpus lanes current: Ubuntu system Perl, the cached CPAN top 1000 install, and the repo-owned corpus audit
- Fold internal torture and edge-case suites into routine verification receipts
- Resume parser, corpus, semantic, and DAP hardening after the release-channel receipts are closed
- Track the post-parser semantic build-out through the [compiler-backed LSP roadmap](../COMPILER_BACKED_LSP_ROADMAP.md), keeping generated metrics in subsystem files rather than duplicating them here

**Later**
- DAP preview hardening (deeper live variables/evaluate, shim packaging, cross-editor native receipts)
- Full LSP 3.18 compliance
- Broader distribution packaging

See [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) for milestone details.

## Known Constraints

- **Tracked test debt**: see `scripts/ignored-test-count.sh`; feature-gated ignores are by design
- **Docs scope**: `perl-parser` `missing_docs` is ratcheted; workspace-wide enforcement is a separate decision
- **Coverage scope**: the workspace baseline intentionally excludes tests, benches, examples, `archive/`, and embedded tree-sitter crates
- **Coverage gate**: `just coverage-summary` still depends on residual workspace test failures found during the March 17 sweep
- **Index state machine**: verification receipts are captured separately and summarized below

## How to Update

1. Run `just status-update` to regenerate all four subsystem files
2. Run `just status-update parser` to regenerate only the parser subsystem (post-merge)
3. Run `just status-check` to verify generated sections are current
4. Run `just ci-gate` to verify the repo-level receipt still passes
5. Edit narrative sections (this file, `release.md`) only after the evidence is current

**Historical archives**: see [reference archive](../../reference/archive/) for retained historical docs and completion history.
