# Unclosed Paren Identifier Shape Analysis

This is a hand-owned analysis note for the raw
`unclosed_paren_identifier` parser bucket. It groups repeated source-backed
fixture shapes so the next parser lane can choose a narrow grammar repair
instead of adding isolated fixtures by default.

## Claim Boundary

Evidence sources:

- [parser accuracy next](parser_accuracy_next.md)
- [parser raw failure buckets](parser.md#raw-failure-buckets)
- `.ci/parser-corpus-baseline.json`
- `crates/perl-parser-core/tests/unclosed_paren_identifier_tests.rs`

Current generated status reports:

- denominator: 50 fixtures / 29 families; 139 scored lines; 117 scored symbols
- failure packets: 0 active
- capability pointer: `parser.md#raw-failure-buckets`
- stale raw bucket route: `heredoc / delimiter handling` ->
  `unclosed_paren_identifier`

The raw bucket receipt is stale: profile `system`, commit `3c287d7db`,
generated `2026-04-28`, Perl `5.038002`, and `86` resolved roots. This note
does not claim current corpus movement or bucket reduction. Linux corpus
refresh remains the proof step before any bucket-count movement is claimed.

## 2026-05-18 Linux Refresh Outcome

A fresh WSL system-corpus sweep on commit `f52dd0065` produced a new local
receipt at `target/receipts/system-corpus-sweep.json`, but it failed ratchet
enforcement and therefore did not update `.ci/parser-corpus-baseline.json` or
generated parser status.

Refresh summary:

- total files: 7095
- clean files: 6935, up from the committed baseline's 6871
- dirty files: 112, down from 176
- total ERROR nodes: 228, down from 536
- `unclosed_paren_identifier`: absent from the fresh first-error buckets
- ratchet violations: `unexpected_rparen_expr` increased from 8 to 18 and
  `unexpected_rbrace_expr` increased from 6 to 8

See [Linux system corpus refresh](../../forensics/2026-05-18-linux-system-corpus-refresh.md)
for the measurement details and claim boundary. This note remains useful as an
archive of the stale source-backed shape analysis, but it should not start a
runtime parser repair by itself. The next current bucket investigation should
use a source-backed `unexpected_rparen_expr` or `unexpected_rbrace_expr` fixture,
or another ratchet-clearing Linux corpus receipt.

## Stale Source Families

The stale receipt lists these duplicated source families under
`unclosed_paren_identifier`:

- `Unicode/Collate.pm`
- `Unicode/Normalize.pm`
- `Carp.pm`
- `ExtUtils/MM_Unix.pm`
- `Pod/Simple/XHTML.pm`
- `Regexp/Common/comment.pm`

These names are discovery pointers, not current failure proof.

## Repeated Shapes

### 1. Block-list pipelines in expression contexts

Shape:

- `map BLOCK`, `grep BLOCK`, and `sort BLOCK` chains inside returns,
  assignments, for-lists, and argument lists
- nested block-list operators followed by another source list expression

Representative locked tests:

- `unicode_collate_sort_map_arrayref_pipeline`
- `dbi_registry_map_block_over_grep_block`
- `regexp_common_comment_combine_parenthesized_map_args`
- `extutils_mm_unix_map_over_grep_substitution`

Repair hypothesis:

Strengthen list-operator parsing so block-list terms and their following source
lists terminate consistently inside parenthesized and comma-list contexts.

### 2. `map EXPR, LIST` with quote-like or call expressions

Shape:

- `map EXPR, LIST` where the mapped expression is a quote-like operator,
  method call, builtin call, coderef call, or regex constructor
- caller contexts such as `join`, `pack`, `return`, lexical assignment, and
  parenthesized assignment

Representative locked tests:

- `extutils_mm_unix_ldrun_join_map_qq_rpath`
- `extutils_mm_unix_mpl_args_join_map_qq_brackets`
- `unicode_normalize_printable_map_sprintf_split`
- `pod_simple_xhtml_entity_regex_map_assignment`

Repair hypothesis:

Clarify map-expression boundaries for quote-like expressions (`qq{}`, `qq[]`,
`qr{}`) and call expressions so the following list operand is not mistaken for
an unclosed caller expression.

### 3. Pair and tuple construction from map

Shape:

- map bodies that return key/value pairs or parenthesized tuples
- unary-plus pair expressions in argument lists
- tuple-producing map blocks in `for` lists or hash assignments

Representative locked tests:

- `extutils_mm_unix_ignore_map_tuple_qw`
- `extutils_mm_unix_split_command_map_quote_literal_pair`
- `capture_tiny_stash_map_list_assignment`
- `extutils_mm_unix_to_inst_pm_wraplist_map_sort`

Repair hypothesis:

Recognize parenthesized tuple returns and unary-plus pair expressions as map
bodies without treating the tuple close as the caller's grouping boundary.

### 4. Hash/list subscripts and source-list builtins

Shape:

- source lists built from `keys`, `split`, `unpack`, and sorted key lists
- dereferenced array or hash sources
- hash-slice index lists that contain map expressions

Representative locked tests:

- `extutils_mm_unix_hash_slice_map_lc_keys_assignment`
- `extutils_mm_unix_attrs_join_map_qq_hash_lookup`
- `unicode_collate_hst_join_map_split_expr`
- `unicode_collate_unpack_u_coderef_map_expr`
- `extutils_mm_unix_grep_parens_over_map_arrayref_default`

Repair hypothesis:

Tighten source-list termination after `keys`, `split`, `unpack`, dereferenced
array sources, and hash-slice index lists so map/grep source operands do not
consume the parent expression incorrectly.

### 5. Non-map neighboring shapes

Shape:

- main-package variable parsing inside parenthesized expressions
- typeglob assignment with ternary anonymous subs
- dynamic typeglob operands in condition declarations
- imported unary-style calls wrapping builtin typeglob operands
- scalar ternary/caller expressions
- prefix-decrement in repetition expressions
- filehandle and builtin-call parentheses

Representative locked tests:

- `main_package_variable_in_paren_expr`
- `unicode_normalize_typeglob_ternary_native_subs`
- `dynamic_glob_double_scalar_in_condition_decl`
- `reftype_tied_typeglob_comparison`
- `local_carp_not_scalar_ternary_caller`
- `x_repetition_prefix_decrement_in_parens`
- `print_filehandle_in_unless`
- `print_block_filehandle_in_if`

Repair hypothesis:

Keep these out of the first map/grep/sort grammar repair. They are adjacent
`unclosed_paren_identifier` regressions, current follow-up discoveries, or older
locked false-positive shapes, but they do not share the same list-operator
boundary as the repeated map/grep fixture train.

`dynamic_glob_double_scalar_in_condition_decl` is the Data::Printer::Filter::GLOB
shape fixed by #8917. It proves that `*$$glob` in a condition declaration must
be treated as a dynamic typeglob operand, not a static typeglob name followed by
a stray scalar identifier. This is source-backed parser capability evidence,
not Linux raw-bucket movement proof.

`reftype_tied_typeglob_comparison` is the Capture::Tiny shape fixed by #8919.
It proves that an imported unary-style call such as `reftype` may take a nested
builtin bare call whose operand is an explicit typeglob, as in
`reftype tied *STDOUT`. This is source-backed parser capability evidence, not
Linux raw-bucket movement proof.

## AST Boundary Receipts

`crates/perl-parser-core/tests/list_operator_boundary_receipts.rs` now asserts
AST ownership for four representative list-operator shapes:

- DBI map/grep/keys: the outer `map` owns the `grep` source, and the nested
  `grep` owns the `keys` source.
- ExtUtils attrs map/sort/keys: the outer `join` owns the `map` result, the
  `map` owns the `sort` source, and `sort` owns the `keys` source.
- Capture::Tiny map/qw list declaration: the list declaration owns the `map`
  initializer, and the `map` owns its block body plus the `qw` source list.
- Unicode::Collate map/split: the outer `join` owns the `map` result, and the
  `map` owns the `split` source.

These receipt tests prove current AST shape for the representative cases above.
They are stronger than clean-parse fixtures because they assert the parsed call
tree shape, not only the absence of `Error` or `Missing*` nodes. They do not
prove Linux corpus movement, and they do not remove the need for a fresh corpus
receipt before any raw bucket-count claim.

## Recommended Next Parser PR

Do not start a runtime repair from this stale bucket note alone. The 2026-05-18
refresh did not reproduce `unclosed_paren_identifier` as a current first-error
bucket and failed ratchet on adjacent delimiter buckets. Start the
list-operator boundary lane only when current evidence supplies a failing
source-backed case:

```text
fix(parser): repair repeated map/grep/sort expression boundary
```

Scope:

- one parser behavior change
- existing `unclosed_paren_identifier_tests` and
  `list_operator_boundary_receipts` fixtures as the safety net
- a failing source-backed case or fresh Linux receipt evidence before changing
  runtime parser behavior
- no generated status hand edits
- no bucket-count movement claim without the Linux corpus refresh

Valid starting evidence:

- a refreshed Linux receipt shows a current list-operator boundary failure; or
- a focused, source-backed fixture reproduces a boundary failure against the
  current parser.

Otherwise, route capability work to the fresh receipt's current blocking
bucket, starting with `unexpected_rparen_expr`. Fixture-only PRs should continue
only when a new real-Perl source shape is not covered by the existing groups
above.

Recent closeouts:

- #8917 locked and repaired the Data::Printer::Filter::GLOB dynamic typeglob
  condition shape with `dynamic_glob_double_scalar_in_condition_decl`. It did
  not refresh the Linux corpus receipt or claim bucket-count movement.
- #8919 locked and repaired the Capture::Tiny `reftype tied *STDOUT`
  condition shape with `reftype_tied_typeglob_comparison`. It did not refresh
  the Linux corpus receipt or claim bucket-count movement.
