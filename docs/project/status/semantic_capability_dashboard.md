# 0.13.2 Semantic Capability Dashboard

> Human-owned release summary. Keep numeric claims sourced from the generated
> semantic scorecard, shadow-compare receipts, or checked-in fixture tests.

This dashboard is the release-readable view of the semantic proof rail. The
canonical detailed artifacts remain [semantic_scorecard.md](semantic_scorecard.md),
[semantic_scorecard.json](semantic_scorecard.json),
[semantic_shadow_compare.md](semantic_shadow_compare.md), and
[semantic_shadow_compare.json](semantic_shadow_compare.json).

## Release Posture

The 0.13.2 semantic substrate is fixture-backed and available across the core
fact rows. The editor can rely on shared semantic facts for declarations,
definitions, imports, exports, occurrences, package graph edges, references,
inheritance, and role composition in the current deterministic fixtures.

**Dynamic strict-bareword diagnostics are now live runtime behavior.** As of
PR #7880, both push (`textDocument/publishDiagnostics`) and pull
(`textDocument/diagnostic`, `workspace/diagnostic`) paths consume real
`WorkspaceSemanticQueries` when the file is indexed. Production diagnostics
suppress `PL109 UnquotedBareword` false positives across the supported dynamic
boundaries — see [Live Semantic Diagnostics](#live-semantic-diagnostics) below.
When semantic data is unavailable (workspace feature disabled, file not yet
indexed), diagnostics fall back to the legacy path unchanged. Unsupported or
ambiguous dynamic forms fail closed: they do not suppress diagnostics unless
indexed evidence proves the specific bareword may be visible at that point.

The current proof is still intentionally conservative. Dynamic Perl boundaries
are represented instead of guessed, semantic method completion only cuts over
when semantic candidates cover the legacy method set, real-workspace proof is
small, and dedicated semantic query p95 rows are not yet part of the scorecard.

## Live Semantic Diagnostics

Dynamic strict-bareword suppression is live in runtime diagnostics. The
dynamic-diagnostics chain landed across three PRs:

- **#7869** — `dynamic_boundary_at` query, semantic-aware scope conversion,
  `DynamicRequire` provenance fix, `NullSemanticQueries` placeholder
- **#7873** — `DynamicCallableEvidence` enum, order-aware dynamic-import
  evidence, literal-eval named-sub producer, `Foo->import(@names)` detection,
  `dynamic_callable_may_be_visible_at` query, `UnquotedBareword` converter
- **#7880** — runtime wiring through `WorkspaceIndex::with_semantic_queries_for_uri`
  scoped callback, real `WorkspaceImportExtractor` populating `ImportExportIndex`
  during `index_file`, semantic-aware diagnostics method, push + pull wiring

| Case | Production behavior | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `eval "sub NAME { ... }"; NAME();` | Suppresses `PL109 UnquotedBareword` for `NAME` only — unrelated barewords still diagnose. | #7869, #7873, #7880 |
| `Foo->import(@names);` followed by later bareword | Suppresses `PL109` for barewords *after* the import statement. The import is detected by `WorkspaceImportExtractor` and emits an `ImportSpec` with `ImportKind::ManualImport` + `ImportSymbols::Dynamic`. | #7873, #7880 |
| Bareword *before* `Foo->import(@names);` | Still diagnoses — order-aware via `ImportSpec.span_start_byte`. Dynamic evidence does not become a file-global silence switch. | #7873, #7880 |
| `eval "sub generated_from_string { 1 }"; truly_undefined_sub();` | Only `generated_from_string` suppressed; `truly_undefined_sub` still diagnoses (different name, no evidence). | #7873, #7880 |
| No semantic index available | Legacy `PL109` behavior is preserved exactly. The diagnostics call site falls back to the original `get_diagnostics_with_path` when `WorkspaceIndex::with_semantic_queries_for_uri` returns `None`. | #7880 |
| Unknown ordering, non-literal `eval $code`, cross-file `AUTOLOAD`, symbolic dereference, or other truly dynamic sources | Fail closed: no suppression is applied unless indexed semantic evidence proves the same bareword may be visible before the diagnostic point. | #7948, #7949 follow-up proof |

**Conservative policy.** Dynamic evidence suppresses *false precision*; it does
not claim exact symbol resolution. The query layer returns
`Option<DynamicCallableEvidence>` via `SemanticQueries::dynamic_callable_may_be_visible_at`
— `Some` means "this bareword could plausibly be from this dynamic source," not
"this bareword definitely came from here."

**Test form note.** `PL109 UnquotedBareword` fires for bare-identifier nodes
under `use strict 'subs'`. Tests use `print bar;` (bare identifier) rather
than `bar()` (parsed as `FunctionCall`, which doesn't currently emit `PL109`).

**Known limits.** Cross-file `AUTOLOAD` propagation, non-literal `eval $code`,
unknown ordering, symbolic dereference, and other dynamic constructs remain
conservative. They do not suppress diagnostics without indexed evidence for the
specific bareword and point in the file. Broader dynamic surface coverage is
future work tracked by #7948 fixtures and #7949 real-workspace baselines.

| `semantic_query_latency_status` | Limited: no dedicated semantic-query p95 scorecard rows yet | Existing real-project latency suites cover end-to-end LSP p50/p95/p99, but semantic query p95 rows and invalidation receipts remain a follow-up proof item. | [BENCHMARKING.md](../../how-to/BENCHMARKING.md#real-project-latency-suite) |

## Reliable User-Facing Claims

- The scorecard has no unavailable semantic rows for the current deterministic
  fixture family.
- Import completion, visible symbols, method candidates, rename planning,
  safe-delete planning, shadow-regression readiness, and undefined-symbol
  false-positive checks pass the current fixture gates.
- **Dynamic strict-bareword diagnostics are live in production**: push and pull
  diagnostics suppress `PL109 UnquotedBareword` false positives across
  `eval "sub NAME"` and `Foo->import(@names)` boundaries when the file is
  indexed. Legacy diagnostics remain the fallback path when semantic data is
  unavailable.
- Dynamic Perl constructs in the current fixtures are treated conservatively
  instead of being promoted to exact semantic claims.
- Semantic method completion can surface own, inherited, and generated method
  context when the guarded cutover accepts the semantic candidate set.

## Current Limits

- Receiver-shape-driven method ranking is not yet the completion ranking proof.
- Dynamic-boundary diagnostics cover `eval "sub NAME"` and `Foo->import(@names)`
  in production; broader dynamic surface (cross-file `AUTOLOAD` propagation,
  non-literal `eval $code`, symbolic dereference, unknown ordering) remains
  conservative — no false suppression without indexed evidence.
- Real-workspace semantic proof currently covers one small CPAN-style family,
  not the planned Mojolicious, DBIx::Class, test-heavy, or template-heavy set.
- Semantic latency is not yet reported as `symbol_at_p95`,
  `definitions_p95`, `references_p95`, `visible_symbols_at_p95`,
  `method_candidates_p95`, `completion_semantic_p95`, or
  `single_file_fact_rebuild_p95`.
- Two semantic producers (`workspace_import_extractor`, `eval_sub_extractor`)
  currently live in `crates/perl-workspace/src/semantic/` rather than their
  ideal home in `perl-semantic-analyzer`, due to the current
  `perl-semantic-analyzer → perl-workspace` dependency direction. Tracked as
  follow-up to invert the dependency arc; see #7875.
