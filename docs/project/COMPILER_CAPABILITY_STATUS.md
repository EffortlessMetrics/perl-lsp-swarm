# Compiler Capability Status

This page tracks the Rust compiler-substrate build-out for `perl-lsp`.

The product remains the language server. The compiler substrate is the
load-bearing model that turns parsed Perl into editor facts with provenance,
confidence, and dynamic-boundary behavior.

The compile-state layer set and its cross-cutting obligations are contracted in
[PLSP-SPEC-0030: Compile state layers](../specs/PLSP-SPEC-0030-compile-state-layers.md).

Do not copy generated parser metrics here. For parser truth, use:

- [Parser status](status/parser.md)
- [Parser accuracy next](status/parser_accuracy_next.md)

## Status Model

Capability states:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `planned` | Issue-owned, no canonical implementation yet |
| `fixture-backed` | Model has focused fixtures, no provider cutover |
| `semantic-shadowed` | Existing semantic facts are scorecarded or shadowed, but canonical compiler-substrate ownership is still being consolidated |
| `shadowed` | Provider impact is measured without changing live behavior |
| `partial live` | At least one narrowly scoped provider path consumes proven facts with fallback, while broader cutover remains gated |
| `live` | Provider consumes the facts in normal LSP behavior |
| `parked` | Known lane, intentionally not next |

## Stop Rules

- Do not cut providers over before the fact layer is fixture-backed and shadowed.
- Do not treat real Perl as the normal editor runtime.
- Do not erase dynamic Perl uncertainty; emit dynamic-boundary facts.
- Do not add retained compiler caches without owner, key, cap, eviction,
  pressure counter, cleanup event, and regression test.
- Do not update generated parser status by hand.

## Common Verification

Use narrow crate checks for implementation PRs. For status-only changes, use:

```bash
cargo xtask fmt --check
git diff --check
```

For parser control-plane freshness, use:

```bash
cargo xtask metrics parser-accuracy --check
cargo xtask update-status --only parser --check
cargo xtask metrics ratchet-check parser_accuracy
```
