## Active Milestones

### v0.10.0: Post-Release Optimization

**Status**: Active (local; see GitHub milestones for live counts)
**Goal**: Close out v0.10.0 hardening and documentation cleanup.

**Exit Criteria**:
- See `ROADMAP.md` v0.10.0 section (index state machine, documentation cleanup, test debt)

**Constraints**:
- CI pipeline cleanup (#211) blocks merge gates (#210)

---

### v0.10.0: Boring Promises

**Status**: Queued (after v0.10.0)
**Goal**: Freeze the surfaces you're willing to support.

**Exit Criteria**:
- v0.10.0 released and stable
- Capability snapshot + docs aligned
- Benchmarks published under benchmarks/results/
- Upgrade notes exist from v0.8.x → v0.9.x

**Deliverables**:
1. Stability statement (versioning rules)
2. Packaging stance (binaries, crates, platforms)
3. Benchmark publication

**Effort Estimate**: ~40-80 hours after v0.10.0

## Released Milestones

### v0.9.0: Semantic-Ready

**Status**: Released (2026-01-18)
**Goal**: A release that external users can try without reading internal docs.

**Exit Criteria**:
- `nix develop -c just ci-gate` green on MSRV
- `bash scripts/ignored-test-count.sh` shows BUG=0, MANUAL≤1
- README / CURRENT_STATUS / ROADMAP agree (no unbacked claims)
- `cargo install --path crates/perllsp` works cleanly
- Capability snapshot remains stable
- Release notes match advertised capabilities

**Historical blockers**:
- [#211](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/issues/211) - CI Pipeline Cleanup
- [#210](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/issues/210) - Merge-Blocking Gates
- [#143](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/issues/143) - unwrap() panic safety

| `phase:single-file` | Single-file semantic experience | Defs, hovers, completions in-file |
| `phase:workspace` | Multi-file workspace indexing | Cross-file navigation |
