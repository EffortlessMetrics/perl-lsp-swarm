# Active rails

Each rail is an `@INC`-shaped burndown: existing substrate + small
connector PR(s) = user-visible upside for 0.14.0. See
[`RAIL_TEMPLATE.md`](RAIL_TEMPLATE.md) for the canonical shape every rail
follows.

Coworker agents (codex, factory-droid) and human contributors pick from
rails that have **`lane assignment`** matching them and **at least one
phase marked `builder-ready: yes`**.

> **Verification**: every row below references a verified doc path
> (existing on master) and/or a verified GitHub issue. Rails whose
> dedicated rail-doc has not yet been written are listed with their
> umbrella issue as the authoritative source; "Doc" reads
> `(umbrella only)` until a rail-doc lands.

## How rails are added or closed

- **New rail**: create `docs/<area>/<RAIL_NAME>.md` instantiating
  [`RAIL_TEMPLATE.md`](RAIL_TEMPLATE.md). File an umbrella issue using
  the user's tracking-issue body shape (current truth / required change /
  acceptance / claim boundary / do not combine). Add a row to this index
  in the same PR as the new rail-doc.
- **Rail closed**: leave the row in the index for one minor release with
  `Lane: —` and `Open phases: 0`, then prune. The closed `@INC` rail row
  above is the worked example.
- **Rail unverifiable**: do not list it. If the umbrella issue or doc
  path can't be confirmed via `gh api repos/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/issues/<N>`
  or a worktree `Glob`, the row gets dropped from the index until it can.

## Claim boundary

Proves: every rail listed here references a doc that exists on master
and/or an issue number that resolves on GitHub. Does **not** prove:
anything about each rail's content, status, ladder ordering, or
readiness — those remain owned by the rail's own doc and umbrella issue.

## Do not combine

This index is structural scaffolding. Updates to it should be:

- **Pure index edits** (adding a new rail row, marking a rail closed,
  fixing a stale next-action) — single-purpose PR;
- **Never combined** with rail-content changes (substrate / connector /
  status table edits in the rail's own doc), with rail-PR-ladder row
  implementation, or with template changes to `RAIL_TEMPLATE.md`.
