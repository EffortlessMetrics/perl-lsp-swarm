## Scope and proof

This cut contains the final swarm closeout reconciliation: PR #4375 and the
completed target sync PRs #10001/#10002 are now recorded as delivered, with
the current 794-test and 1,472,504-byte package evidence. It is a
documentation-only delta on top of the already-tested modernization cut.

The previous target receipt
`docs/swarm/source-syncs/2026-07-15-workspace-capabilities-bd3eb11b2.md`
records the Node 26 extension gate, cargo check, package/source-map contracts,
and exact-source trusted multi-root/untrusted host smoke. No implementation
or generated package files changed in this final cut.

The complete-tree difference from the pinned cut contains only the approved
`.claude/`, swarm-only cleanup scripts, and target-owned sync-ledger paths.
No per-file resolution was used for shared source files. This receipt does not
authorize publishing, tagging, Docker publication, or release creation.

Post-sync verification: the pinned cut is an ancestor of target `master`, and
the final target tree differs from it only by the approved exclusions and sync
ledgers. Target `master` retains both parent histories through final merge
`3ad0ef92b3e6db63035a0eb108a180cf20c6aef6`.
