# PR Forensics Schema

This document defines the schema for PR archaeology dossiers. Use this when mining merged PRs to extract lessons and evidence.

## Core Principle

> **The product isn't code. It's decisions + proof.**

AI does the typing. Humans do scope calls, design calls, verification calls, acceptance calls, and prevention calls. The artifacts we publish must center those decisions.

## Purpose

PR archaeology extracts actionable patterns from past work:

- What went wrong (and was caught vs. slipped through)
- What the combined budget actually was (DevLT + compute)
- Which guardrails improved because of the PR
- How claims drifted from implementation

## Quality-First Approach

Quality is the primary output. Budget metrics are secondary.

See [`QUALITY_SURFACES.md`](../project/QUALITY_SURFACES.md) for the four quality surfaces:
- **Maintainability**: boundaries, coupling, complexity
- **Correctness**: tests, error paths, mutation survival
- **Governance**: schema alignment, anti-drift, receipts
- **Reproducibility**: gate clarity, limits, environment

## Dossier Structure: Four-Panel Model

Every PR dossier uses a **four-panel structure** to surface measured facts, then derives insights:

| Panel | Type | Question | Key Outputs |
| ----- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1. Change Surface | Measured | Where did this PR land? What got riskier? | Review map (3-8 priority files), integration points |
| 2. Verification Depth | Measured | What is actually proven now? | Proof bundle, "Not measured" explicit list |
| 3. Governance Integrity | Measured | Did we keep truth surfaces honest? | Claim drift list, schema compliance |
| 4. Temporal Topology | Derived | How did it converge? | 3-line convergence story, friction zones |

After the four panels come:
- **Panel 5**: Budget Estimates (with provenance)
- **Panel 6**: Quality Deltas (impact on four quality surfaces)
- **Panel 7**: Factory Delta (systemic improvements)
- **Panel 8**: Exhibit Score (overall assessment)
- **Panel 9**: Next Prevention Actions (actionable items to prevent recurrence)
- **Findings**: Exceptional issues only (optional)

---

## Panel 4: Temporal Topology (Derived)

**Goal**: Show how the PR converged. Identify patterns of iteration, oscillation, stabilization.

### Burst Sessions

Periods of rapid commit activity (within 2-hour windows).

| Session | Timeframe | Commits | Focus |
| ------- | --------- | ------- | ----- |
| Session 1 | 2026-01-05 10:00-12:00 | 8 | Initial parser implementation |
| Session 2 | 2026-01-05 14:00-16:00 | 5 | Test refinement |

### Oscillation Patterns

Files/modules that were rewritten multiple times, dependencies added/removed/re-added, reverts.

| Pattern | Occurrences | Files/Items | Reason |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Same hotspot rewrite | 3 | `parser.rs` | Edge case discovery |
| Dependency churn | 2 | `serde_json` add/remove/add | API design iteration |
| Reverts | 1 | Commit abc123 reverted | Performance regression |

### Stabilization Inflection

The point where logic changes stop and only tests/docs remain.

| Phase | Timeframe | Activity |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| Logic churn | Commits 1-15 | Parser implementation |
| Stabilization | Commits 16-20 | Test coverage, doc updates |
| Polish | Commits 21-23 | Clippy fixes, formatting |

**Inflection point**: Commit 15 (2026-01-05 16:30) - Last logic change before stabilization

### Friction Heatmap

Files touched across many commits, indicating uncertainty or complexity.

| File | Touches | Span (commits) | Friction Type |
| ---- | ------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| `parser.rs` | 12 | 1-20 | High complexity |
| `index.rs` | 8 | 5-18 | API uncertainty |
| `tests/integration.rs` | 6 | 10-23 | Evolving coverage |

### Output: Convergence Story

**3-line summary**:
1. Initial burst (commits 1-8): Core implementation with 3 rewrites of parser.rs
2. Oscillation phase (commits 9-15): API design iteration, dependency churn
3. Stabilization (commits 16-23): Test coverage and polish, no logic changes after commit 15

**Friction zones**:
- `parser.rs`: High complexity drove 12 touches across full PR lifespan
- `index.rs`: API uncertainty required 8 iterations

**Next prevention**:
- Pre-commit design review for parser.rs-level complexity
- API contract validation before implementation for index.rs-level uncertainty

---

## Panel 9: Next Prevention Actions

**Purpose**: Turn forensics into "do better next time" outputs. Every dossier must produce actionable items to prevent recurrence.

### Policy Constraints (Required)

These constraints ensure prevention actions are **deterministic and hard to forget**:

1. **Quality Delta Rule**: If *any* quality delta is `0`, `-1`, or `-2`, at least one prevention action **must** target that surface.
   - Example: If Correctness delta is `-1`, include at least one verification action (9.2).

2. **Friction Rule**: If friction existed (temporal topology shows high-churn files, oscillations, or gate failures), at least one prevention action **must** be a **mechanized guardrail** (gate/receipt/schema), not just "write better docs".
   - Example: If `parser.rs` had 12 touches, add a complexity check gate, not just a design guideline.

3. **Wrongness Rule**: If wrongness was discovered (claim drift, bug, stub), at least one prevention action **must** mechanize detection of that wrongness class.
   - Example: If claim drift occurred, add a drift detection script to ci-gate.

### Enforcement

Dossiers that violate these constraints should not be published until prevention actions are added. Reviewers should verify:

- [ ] Quality deltas at 0/-1/-2 have corresponding prevention actions
- [ ] Friction zones have at least one mechanized guardrail action
- [ ] Discovered wrongness has mechanized detection action

Three categories of actions, ranked by priority:

### 9.1 Code Health Actions (Maintainability)

Actions to improve maintainability and reduce future friction:

- **Split hotspots**: Files too frequently touched across commits
- **Reduce coupling**: Modules too interdependent, changes cascade
- **Clarify boundaries**: Unclear responsibility separation between modules
- **Shrink/document public surface**: Public API needs refinement or documentation

Each action item should include:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| **What** | Specific change needed |
| **Where** | File path or component |
| **Why** | What problem it prevents |
| **Evidence** | How you know it's done |

**Example**:

| What | Where | Why | Evidence |
| ---- | ----- | --- | -------- |
| Split `parser.rs` into `parser/core.rs` and `parser/expressions.rs` | `crates/perl-parser/src/parser.rs` (800+ LOC) | Reduce churn frequency - file touched in 12/23 commits | File split complete, both <400 LOC, clippy passes |
| Extract `IndexProvider` trait to separate module | `crates/perl-lsp-rs/src/index.rs` | Clarify LSP provider boundaries | Trait in `lsp/providers/index.rs`, tests pass |

### 9.2 Verification Actions (Correctness)

Actions to strengthen test coverage and proof quality:

- **Missing unhappy path tests**: Error conditions not exercised
- **Mutation survivors → targeted tests needed**: Mutation testing reveals gaps
- **New fixtures for edge cases discovered**: Integration test scenarios missing
- **Coverage gaps in changed code**: Changed code lacks test coverage

Each action item should include:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| **What** | Specific test or fixture needed |
| **Where** | Test file or coverage gap location |
| **Why** | What correctness issue it prevents |
| **Evidence** | How you know it's done |

**Example**:

| What | Where | Why | Evidence |
| ---- | ----- | --- | -------- |
| Add property test for surrogate pair edge cases | `tests/property_utf16.rs` | Current tests missed 2-rewrite friction in utf16.rs | Quickcheck test added, utf16.rs mutation score >90% |
| Add integration fixture for multi-file workspace navigation | `tests/fixtures/workspace_multi/` | No test for dual indexing across files | Fixture exists, LSP navigation test passes |
| Test error recovery path in `index.rs:567` | `tests/lsp_index_test.rs` | Mutation survivor indicates untested error path | Mutation killed, test fails when error handling removed |

### 9.3 Factory Actions (Process)

Actions to improve the development factory itself:

- **New preflight gate to prevent this friction class**: Automated check missing
- **Tighten schema/contracts**: Documentation or API contract unclear
- **Add/adjust lane rules**: Workflow or routing logic needs refinement
- **New receipt requirement**: Quality evidence missing from gate

Each action item should include:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| **What** | Specific process change |
| **Where** | Justfile, CI config, or documentation |
| **Why** | What friction class it prevents |
| **Evidence** | How you know it's done |

**Example**:

| What | Where | Why | Evidence |
| ---- | ----- | --- | -------- |
| Add `just check-complexity` gate (max 400 LOC/file) | `justfile`, `scripts/complexity-check.sh` | Prevent parser.rs-level hotspots (800+ LOC) | Gate fails on >400 LOC, documented in COMMANDS_REFERENCE.md |
| Require mutation score receipt in PR template | `.github/pull_request_template.md` | Ensure mutation testing runs before merge | Template updated, PR checklist includes mutation score |
| Add pre-implementation design template for >500 LOC changes | `docs/DESIGN_TEMPLATE.md` | Prevent API oscillation (8 touches to index.rs) | Template exists, used in next large PR |

### Output: Prevention Plan

**Summary**: Select 2-3 actions per category (6-9 total) that best address the PR's friction patterns.

**Priority ranking**: Order by expected impact on preventing similar friction in future PRs.

**Tracking**: Link to issues created for each action if implementation is deferred beyond current PR.

## Panel 5: Budget Estimates (with Provenance)

Every metric includes provenance. See [`METRICS_PROVENANCE.md`](../project/METRICS_PROVENANCE.md).

| Metric | Value | Kind | Confidence | Basis |
| ------ | ----- | ---- | ---------- | ----- |
| DevLT | X–Ym | estimated | high/med/low | decision events, friction events |
| CI | Zm | measured | high | workflow run ID |
| LLM units | ~N | estimated | med | iteration count |

**DevLT estimation** uses a decision-weighted method (decision events + friction events per exhibit).

Bands for DevLT (reference):
- **<30 min**: Quick fix, no exploration needed
- **30-120 min**: Standard feature, some investigation
- **120+ min**: Complex, multi-session work

Bands for compute (reference):
- **Cheap**: <10K tokens, <5 CI minutes
- **Moderate**: 10-100K tokens, 5-30 CI minutes
- **Expensive**: >100K tokens, >30 CI minutes

**Coverage declaration** (required):
- `receipts_included`: Agent logs, token receipts available
- `github_plus_agent_logs`: GitHub + session logs
- `github_only`: PR thread, commits, CI only

### 9.2 Verification Actions (Correctness)

| What | Where | Why | Evidence |
| ---- | ----- | --- | -------- |
| Add property test for BMP edge cases | `tests/property_utf16.rs` | Current coverage partial for non-BMP unicode | Test added, 1000 iterations with BMP boundaries |
| Test mutation survivor in lexer.rs:234 | `tests/lexer_test.rs` | Comment parsing boundary untested | New test kills mutation, lexer.rs score >90% |
| Add integration fixture for LSP client compatibility | `tests/fixtures/lsp_clients/` | Only VS Code tested, gap acknowledged | Emacs, Neovim fixtures added |

### 9.3 Factory Actions (Process)

| What | Where | Why | Evidence |
| ---- | ----- | --- | -------- |
| Add cargo-mutants to pre-push hook | `scripts/install-githooks.sh` | Prevent mutation score regression | Hook runs mutants on changed files only |
| Create Unicode research checklist | `docs/UNICODE_CHECKLIST.md` | Prevent surrogate pair discovery during implementation | Checklist exists, includes surrogate pair section |

**Priority ranking**:
1. Document unsafe blocks (immediate maintainability win)
2. Add mutation survivor tests (close correctness gap)
3. Add cargo-mutants to pre-push (prevent regression)
4. Create Unicode checklist (prevent similar friction)
5. Extract validation module (reduce future churn)
6. Add BMP property tests (expand correctness coverage)

**Tracking**: Issues #160-#165 created for deferred actions

## Findings

None - clean PR.
```

## How to Use

1. Pick a merged PR to analyze
2. Create `docs/forensics/pr-NNN.md`
3. Fill in the **four measurement panels first** (Change Surface, Verification Depth, Governance Integrity, Temporal Topology)
4. Derive budget estimates, quality deltas, factory improvements from measured data
5. Complete exhibit scoring
6. Add systemic findings to `docs/project/LESSONS.md` if patterns emerge
7. Update guardrails if gaps are found

### Panel Completion Order

**Phase 1: Measured Facts** (automation-friendly)
1. Panel 1 (Change Surface) - Use git tooling to extract file deltas, churn, dependencies
2. Panel 2 (Verification Depth) - Parse CI logs, test output, mutation reports
3. Panel 3 (Governance Integrity) - Run schema validators, diff catalog files

**Phase 2: Derived Insights** (human analysis)
4. Panel 4 (Temporal Topology) - Analyze commit timeline for patterns
5. Panel 5 (Budget Estimates) - Apply DevLT estimation method
6. Panel 6 (Quality Deltas) - Assess impact on quality surfaces

**Phase 3: Synthesis**
7. Panel 7 (Factory Delta) - Identify systemic improvements
8. Panel 8 (Exhibit Score) - Overall assessment
9. Panel 9 (Next Prevention Actions) - Actionable items to prevent recurrence
10. Findings (optional) - Document exceptional issues

### Backward Compatibility

Existing dossiers following the 8-section structure remain valid. The four-panel model is a reorganization and enhancement of the existing schema, not a breaking change. Tools reading dossiers should support both formats.
