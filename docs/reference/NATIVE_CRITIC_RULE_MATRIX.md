# Native Critic Rule Matrix

The **native critic** is perl-lsp's built-in static-analysis linter. It ships in
the server binary and requires **no external tools** — `perlcritic` /
`Perl::Critic` are only used when you explicitly select the legacy engine (see
[Configuration](#configuration)). This page is the product reference for every
rule the native analyzer ships: its rule ID, category, severity, the LSP
diagnostic severity it maps to, and which profile enables it.

> Source of truth: rule definitions live in
> `crates/perl-lsp-rs-core/src/tooling/perl_critic/native.rs`; the profiles and
> filtering live in `.../perl_critic/native/native_registry.rs`; the severity
> model lives in `.../perl_critic/types.rs`. This doc is transcribed from that
> code and is enforced against it — if it drifts, treat the code as correct.

## Configuration

The native critic is configured by the `[critic]` table in `.perl-lsp.toml`
(and the equivalent `perl-lsp.critic.*` editor settings). See
[CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md) for the full schema.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `[critic] engine` | `native` | `native` (built-in) or `legacy` (external `perlcritic`). |
| `[critic] profile` | `recommended` | Base rule set: `recommended` (16 rules) or `strict` (all 28). |
| `[critic] include` | `[]` | **Whitelist, resolved against the full rule catalog.** When non-empty, exactly the listed rule IDs run. A listed rule that the profile does not contain is pulled in from the full catalog, so `include` can enable a strict-only rule without switching profile. Unknown IDs match nothing and are warned about at config load. |
| `[critic] exclude` | `[]` | Rule IDs to remove from the selected profile. |

**Severity threshold** is configured separately, **not** under `[critic]`. It is
`[diagnostics] perlcritic_severity` in `.perl-lsp.toml` (or the
`perl-lsp.perlcritic.severity` / `perl-lsp.critic.severity` editor setting), and
it applies to the native engine too: a rule is reported only when its severity
is at or above the threshold (default `3`).

> To run a strict-only rule (e.g. `native.variables.unused_lexical`) on its
> own, add it to `include`; the rule is resolved from the full catalog and runs
> even under the `recommended` profile. Remember that a non-empty `include` is
> still a whitelist: only the listed rules run, so list every rule you want. To
> keep the whole recommended set *plus* extra rules, either list them all or set
> `profile = "strict"` and `exclude` what you don't want.

## Severity model

Each rule has a native `Severity`. The numeric value drives both the severity
threshold filter (`perlcritic_severity`, see [Configuration](#configuration))
and the mapping to an LSP diagnostic severity:

| Native severity | Numeric | LSP `DiagnosticSeverity` |
|-----------------|:-------:|--------------------------|
| `Gentle` | 5 | `ERROR` |
| `Stern` | 4 | `WARNING` |
| `Harsh` | 3 | `WARNING` |
| `Cruel` | 2 | `INFORMATION` |
| `Brutal` | 1 | `HINT` |

A finding is kept only when `rule_severity >= perlcritic_severity`. At the default
threshold of `3`, every shipped native rule passes (the lowest native severity
in use is `Harsh` = 3). Raising the threshold to `4` drops the `Harsh` rules;
`5` produces no findings (no shipped rule uses `Gentle`). No shipped native rule
uses `Gentle` (5), `Cruel` (2), or `Brutal` (1), so native diagnostics are
always `WARNING`.

## Profiles

`profile` selects the active rule set. **Recommended** is the balanced
default (16 rules). **Strict** is a strict superset — the same 16 plus 12 more
(28 total). `include` (whitelist) / `exclude` (blacklist) then narrow that set
by rule ID. `exclude` only removes; `include` resolves against the full 28-rule
catalog, so it can name a rule the profile does not contain.

## Rule matrix

Categories in use: **Security**, **Syntax**, **Semantic**, **Maintainability**,
**Documentation**. (The `Workspace` and `Style` categories exist in the model
but no shipped rule uses them.)

**Recommended profile** (16 rules): the first 16 rows above (through
`native.security.system_exec`) — the security- and correctness-critical set.
**Strict profile** (28 rules): all rows.

## Notes on defaults

- The documented config default is `critic.profile = "recommended"`, so a normal
  configuration yields the **16-rule Recommended** profile.
- If the profile string fails to parse (absent or an unrecognized token), the
  runtime falls back to **Strict**, not Recommended
  (`NativeCriticProfile::parse(...).unwrap_or(NativeCriticProfile::Strict)` in
  the diagnostics, pull-diagnostics, and `perl.runCritic` paths). Set a valid
  `recommended`/`strict` token to get deterministic behavior.
- `## no critic` suppression comments are honored (see
  `native/native_suppressions.rs`).

## Suppressing a rule

- Disable one rule from the active profile: add its ID to `[critic] exclude`.
- Run a strict-only rule: add its ID to `[critic] include` (it is resolved from
  the full catalog under any profile), remembering that a non-empty `include`
  runs *only* the listed rules. To run the whole strict set instead, set
  `[critic] profile = "strict"` and `exclude` the ones you don't want.
- Suppress inline with a `## no critic <rule ids>` comment. The directive opens
  at its own line and stays open until a `## use critic` comment closes it, or
  until the end of the file if nothing closes it. It never applies to findings
  above itself, so placing one on the offending line also suppresses every later
  matching finding in the file — close it with `## use critic` to bound the
  region. This is a native contract, not Perl::Critic statement-scoped parity.
