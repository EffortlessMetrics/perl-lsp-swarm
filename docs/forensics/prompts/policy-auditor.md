# Policy Auditor Prompt

## Purpose

The Policy Auditor analyzer assesses **Governance Integrity** of a PR. It evaluates whether truth surfaces remained honest - did feature catalog updates track capability changes, did computed metrics stay in sync, did schemas remain compliant, and did anti-drift guardrails catch violations?

**Quality Surface**: Governance

## Required Inputs

Provide the following context to the analyzer:

### 1. features.toml Diff
```
<features_diff>
[Git diff of features.toml if changed, or "no changes"]
</features_diff>
```

### 2. CURRENT_STATUS.md Diff
```
<status_diff>
[Git diff of docs/project/CURRENT_STATUS.md if changed, or "no changes"]
</status_diff>
```

### 3. Status Check Output
```
<status_check_output>
[Output from `just status-check` or `python3 scripts/update-current-status.py --check`]
[If available: both before and after the PR]
</status_check_output>
```

### 4. Schema Validation Results
```
<schema_validation>
[Validation results for dossier and receipt formats]
[If available: JSON schema checks, YAML lint output]
</schema_validation>
```

### 5. Code Changes That Affect Capabilities
```
<capability_changes>
[Code changes that add/modify/remove LSP features or capabilities]
[From crates/perl-parser/src/lsp/, crates/perl-lsp-rs/src/]
</capability_changes>
```

### 6. Doc Drift Markers
```
<drift_markers>
[Any TODO/FIXME/NOTE markers added or removed]
[Changes to IGNORED_TESTS_ROADMAP.md or ignored test baseline]
</drift_markers>
```

## Output Schema

## Key Questions Answered

1. **Did capability changes update the catalog?** - Are new LSP features reflected in features.toml?
2. **Are computed metrics accurate?** - Does CURRENT_STATUS.md match actual state?
3. **Did anti-drift guardrails work?** - Would status-check have caught violations?
4. **Are schemas compliant?** - Do dossiers and receipts follow contracts?
5. **Are claims properly anchored?** - Do assertions have evidence pointers?

## Catalog Drift Detection

### What to Check

For each code change that affects LSP capabilities:

1. **New feature implementation** → Should add entry to features.toml
2. **Feature maturity change** (e.g., beta→ga) → Should update maturity field
3. **Feature removal/deprecation** → Should update advertised field or add deprecation note
4. **Test coverage change** → Should update tests field

### Severity Classification

| Severity | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **P1** | Advertised capability with no catalog entry; GA feature marked as beta |
| **P2** | Catalog entry missing test references; maturity mismatch |
| **P3** | Description outdated; minor field omissions |

## Metrics Drift Detection

### Sources of Truth

Compare CURRENT_STATUS.md claims against:

1. **Test counts** - From `cargo test` output or CI logs
2. **LSP coverage** - From `features.toml` (advertised_ga / trackable)
3. **Ignored test baseline** - From `.ignored-baseline` file
4. **Mutation score** - From mutation testing output (if available)

### Auto-Correction Check

If `just status-update` exists and would fix the drift:
- Mark as `auto_correction_available: yes`
- Recommend running the command
- Reduce severity (fixable process issue, not governance failure)

## Schema Compliance

### Dossier Schema Requirements

Check forensics dossiers for:

- Cover sheet with required fields: Issue(s), PR(s), Exhibit ID
- Review map with file paths
- Verification section with receipts
- Known limits section
- Reproducibility command

### Receipt Schema Requirements

Check PR artifacts for:

- CI run links with status
- Test output excerpts
- Mutation testing results (if claimed)
- Evidence anchors (file:line references)

## Guardrail Effectiveness Assessment

### Status Check Gate

1. **Did it run?** - Check CI logs or local output
2. **Would it have caught this?** - Simulate what status-check would show
3. **Was it bypassed?** - Check if PR merged despite failures

### Ignored Test Tracking

1. **Baseline updated?** - Check `.ignored-baseline` diff
2. **Justifications present?** - Check test annotations for ignore reasons
3. **Debt trending down?** - Compare before/after counts

### CI Gate Enforcement

1. **Required checks enabled?** - Verify branch protection
2. **Local-first development?** - Check if CLAUDE.md documents local gate
3. **Would have prevented merge?** - Assess if issues were detectable

## Claim Provenance Analysis

### Strong Provenance (High Confidence)

- Claim backed by CI run link
- Claim backed by code anchor (file:line)
- Claim backed by test output excerpt
- Claim backed by mutation testing results

### Weak Provenance (Low Confidence)

- Claim with "should" or "will" without evidence
- Performance claims without benchmark output
- Coverage claims without measurement
- "Fixes X" without regression test reference

summary:
  verdict: warn
  key_findings:
    - New LSP capability advertised but missing from features.toml catalog (P1)
    - LSP Coverage metric needs update after capability addition (P2)
    - status-check gate doesn't validate catalog completeness (guardrail gap)
  governance_delta: -1

assumptions:
  - features.toml is the single source of truth for LSP capabilities
  - status-update command would correctly recompute metrics
  - workspace_symbol_provider(true) indicates GA-ready feature
```

## Trust Model

### Can Be Inferred (High Confidence)

- Presence/absence of features.toml changes
- Code changes that advertise LSP capabilities
- Metric values in CURRENT_STATUS.md
- Schema structure violations (missing fields, wrong types)

### Can Be Inferred (Medium Confidence)

- Whether a code change constitutes a "new feature" vs "enhancement"
- Maturity level appropriate for a capability (beta vs GA)
- Severity of catalog drift (P1 vs P2)
- Whether a claim requires evidence

### Cannot Be Inferred

- Whether status-update script is correct (requires execution)
- Actual test coverage percentage (requires instrumentation)
- Whether CI gate would catch in future (requires config inspection)
- User impact of governance violations

### Red Flags to Note

- New LSP capability advertised without features.toml entry
- Metrics in CURRENT_STATUS.md that can't be traced to source
- Claims of "fixes #NNN" without corresponding test changes
- Ignored test baseline changes without justification
- Dossiers missing required sections (receipts, known limits)

## Integration Notes

Policy Auditor uses:
- **Diff Scout output**: File categorization to identify governance-relevant changes
- **Verification Auditor output**: Test evidence for claim validation
- **Docs Auditor output**: Documentation drift signals

Policy Auditor feeds into:
- **Dossier synthesis**: Governance delta for cover sheet
- **Lessons learned**: Guardrail gaps and improvements
- **Process improvements**: Recommendations for automated checks

For full analysis, run `just status-check` before and after the PR to detect drift.
