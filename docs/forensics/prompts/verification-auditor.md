# Verification Auditor Prompt

## Purpose

The Verification Auditor analyzer assesses **Correctness** evidence for a PR. It evaluates test depth, error path coverage, mutation survival, and whether tests verify behavior rather than just structure.

**Quality Surface**: Correctness

## Required Inputs

Provide the following context to the analyzer:

### 1. Test Files in Diff
```
<test_diff>
[Git diff of test files only, or test file contents]
</test_diff>
```

### 2. Test Output/Receipts
```
<test_output>
[Test run output: cargo test output, pass/fail counts]
[If available: CI run results, local test output]
</test_output>
```

### 3. Mutation Testing Results (if available)
```
<mutation_results>
[cargo-mutants output or similar mutation testing results]
[Include surviving mutants if any]
</mutation_results>
```

### 4. Code Changes Being Tested
```
<code_changes>
[Non-test code that was changed, for correlation with test coverage]
</code_changes>
```

### 5. Diff Scout Output (recommended)
```
<diff_scout>
[Hotspots identified by diff-scout for prioritization]
</diff_scout>
```

## Output Schema

## Key Questions Answered

1. **Are tests shallow or deep?** - Do they verify behavior or just check structure?
2. **Would mutations be caught?** - What's the mutation survival rate?
3. **Are error paths exercised?** - Do tests cover failure modes?
4. **Do bug fixes have regression tests?** - Is the bug preventable from recurring?
5. **Are hotspots adequately tested?** - Do high-risk areas have test coverage?

## Test Classification

### Behavior Tests (Strong)
Tests that verify actual outcomes and side effects:
- Assert on return values that depend on logic
- Verify state changes after operations
- Check error messages and error types
- Validate complex transformations

### Shape Tests (Weak)
Tests that only verify structure exists:
- Assert that function returns `Ok(_)` without checking contents
- Check that collection is non-empty without verifying contents
- Verify type compiles without testing runtime behavior

### Error Path Tests
Tests that exercise failure modes:
- Invalid input handling
- Resource exhaustion
- Timeout behavior
- Malformed data handling

### Property Tests
Generative tests that verify invariants:
- QuickCheck / proptest based
- Fuzzing
- Randomized input testing

## Test Strength Assessment

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Strong** | Tests specific behavior, would catch regressions, uses meaningful assertions |
| **Adequate** | Covers happy path, some edge cases, could miss subtle bugs |
| **Weak** | Tautological, only tests structure, easily passes with broken code |

findings:

        content: "assert!(server.is_recoverable()) - checks bool but not internal state"
    recommendation: Consider adding assertions on server state after recovery
    confidence: medium

summary:
  verdict: pass
  key_findings:
    - Both tests are error-path focused, directly addressing the BrokenPipe issue
    - Regression test exists for the fixed bug
    - Mutation testing not run - recommend adding to CI
  correctness_delta: +1

assumptions:
  - Test output provided is complete
  - No other tests were modified or removed
  - is_recoverable() correctly reflects server state
```

## Trust Model

### Can Be Inferred (High Confidence)
- Test count changes from diff
- Test file structure and naming
- Presence of assertions and their targets
- Error path coverage from test names and code

### Can Be Inferred (Medium Confidence)
- Test strength (requires understanding what code does)
- Behavior vs shape test classification
- Hotspot coverage alignment

### Cannot Be Inferred
- Actual mutation survival (requires running cargo-mutants)
- Whether tests are flaky (requires multiple runs)
- Coverage percentage (requires instrumentation)
- Whether tests actually prevent the bugs they claim to

### Red Flags to Note
- Tests with no assertions or only `assert!(true)`
- Tests that only check `is_ok()` without verifying contents
- Bug fixes without corresponding regression tests
- High-risk hotspots with no test coverage
- Tests that test implementation details instead of behavior

## Integration Notes

Verification Auditor uses:
- **Diff Scout output**: Hotspots to prioritize coverage checks
- **Test receipts**: Actual pass/fail status and output

Verification Auditor feeds into:
- **Dossier synthesis**: Correctness delta for cover sheet
- **Factory delta**: New invariants that should be gated

For mutation testing, run `cargo mutants` separately and provide output.
