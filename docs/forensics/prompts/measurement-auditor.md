# Measurement Auditor Prompt

## Purpose

The Measurement Auditor analyzer validates **Metrics Integrity** - auditing whether the numbers reported in PR forensics dossiers, status updates, and receipts actually match what was measured. It detects theater metrics, validates provenance chains, and ensures reproducibility.

**Quality Surface**: Measurement Honesty

## Required Inputs

Provide the following context to the analyzer:

### 1. Dossier Draft or Status Update
```
<dossier_draft>
[The document containing metrics claims to be audited]
[PR forensics dossier, CURRENT_STATUS.md update, or receipt]
</dossier_draft>
```

### 2. Tool Outputs (Receipts)
```
<tool_receipts>
[Raw output from measurement tools:]
[- cargo test output with counts]
[- cargo mutants results]
[- git log/diff output]
[- CI run logs]
[- just status-check output]
[- bash scripts/ignored-test-count.sh output]
</tool_receipts>
```

### 3. Git Context
```
<git_context>
[Commit SHAs being compared (base and head)]
[Merge base information if applicable]
[Output from: git log --oneline base..head]
[Output from: git diff --stat base..head]
</git_context>
```

### 4. CI/Gate Outputs (if available)
```
<ci_outputs>
[CI run results with metrics]
[Local gate outputs: just ci-gate]
[Benchmark results if performance claimed]
</ci_outputs>
```

### 5. Measurement Commands Used
```
<measurement_commands>
[Commands that were run to obtain metrics]
[Scripts invoked for measurements]
[Environment variables used (e.g., RUST_TEST_THREADS)]
</measurement_commands>
```

## Measurement Contract Rules

**Hard rule**: If the measurement contract cannot be proven stable, the auditor **does not bless comparisons** - it marks them `not_comparable`.

### Contract Stability Criteria

A measurement contract is **stable** when:
1. **Denominator unchanged**: Same test suite, same coverage scope, same dataset
2. **Units unchanged**: Same metrics (percentages, counts, durations)
3. **Methodology unchanged**: Same tools, same configurations, same flags
4. **Baseline verified**: Comparison baseline is the correct commit (base SHA)

A measurement contract is **changed** when any of the above shift without explicit acknowledgment.

A measurement contract is **unknown** when insufficient evidence exists to determine stability.

### Comparability Decisions

| Contract Status | Comparability | Action Required |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| stable | comparable | Bless the comparison |
| changed (acknowledged) | conditional | Require side-by-side with old methodology |
| changed (unacknowledged) | not_comparable | Block publication, require fix |
| unknown | not_comparable | Block publication, require evidence |

### Common Contract Violations

1. **Semantics drift**: "Coverage" meant X, now means Y
2. **Baseline drift**: Comparing to wrong commit without stating so
3. **Over-claiming**: Multipliers ("4x faster") without absolute numbers + contracts
4. **Reproducibility gaps**: Missing commands, env vars, dataset hashes

## Key Questions Answered

1. **Does every number have a clear source?** - Can we trace metrics back to tool output?
2. **Can measurements be reproduced?** - Are commands and receipts sufficient to re-run?
3. **Are any metrics inflated or cherry-picked?** - Do numbers represent honest measurement?
4. **Is "not measured" explicitly stated?** - Are coverage gaps acknowledged?
5. **Are delta calculations correct?** - Do base/head comparisons use correct SHAs and account for merge strategy?

## Provenance Requirements

### Strong Provenance (High Confidence)

Metrics with clear source chain:
- Test count from `cargo test` output excerpt
- Mutation score from `cargo mutants` output with summary
- Line count from `git diff --stat` output
- CI timing from linked CI run
- Ignored test count from `.ignored-baseline` file or script output

### Weak Provenance (Low Confidence)

Metrics without clear source:
- "Improved performance" without benchmark results
- "Better coverage" without coverage tool output
- "Fixed N bugs" without issue references
- Percentages calculated without showing inputs
- Deltas without base/head SHAs

### No Provenance (Unverifiable)

Unanchored claims:
- Qualitative assessments presented as metrics
- Aggregations without component values
- Historical comparisons without historical data
- "Estimated" values without estimation method

## Theater Metric Patterns

### Cherry-Picking Red Flags

- Reporting only passing tests, not total test suite
- Highlighting one fast operation, ignoring slow paths
- Showing coverage for one module, not workspace
- Reporting mutation score for subset of code

### Inflation Patterns

- Rounding up percentages aggressively (87.3% → 90%)
- Counting tests that were commented out as "added"
- Including unrelated changes in delta metrics
- Presenting LOC as proxy for complexity/value

### Misleading Comparisons

- Comparing optimized build to debug baseline
- Using wrong merge base for delta calculation
- Comparing different test configurations (threaded vs single)
- Cherry-picking time window for performance comparison

## Coverage Honesty Assessment

### Excellent

- Every major quality dimension addressed
- "Not measured" explicitly stated with reason
- Known limits section acknowledges gaps
- Reproducibility commands provided

### Adequate

- Most quality dimensions covered
- Some implicit "not measured" (omitted metrics)
- Basic reproducibility possible
- Minor gaps acknowledged

### Weak

- Only subset of dimensions measured
- Many implicit gaps
- Reproducibility unclear
- No acknowledgment of limits

### Missing

- No coverage honesty section
- Metrics presented without context
- Unknown unknowns not considered
- Theater metrics suspected

## Delta Correctness

### What to Check

For any before/after comparison:

1. **Base SHA verified** - Is the "before" state clearly identified?
2. **Head SHA verified** - Is the "after" state clearly identified?
3. **Merge base correct** - For PR comparisons, was merge base computed correctly?
4. **Context preserved** - Are environmental factors (flags, threading) constant?

### Common Delta Errors

- Using wrong branch as base (master vs actual merge base)
- Comparing HEAD to parent commit when PR has multiple commits
- Not accounting for concurrent changes to base branch
- Comparing different build configurations

## Calculation Verification

### Verifiable Calculations

When inputs and formula are clear:
- `(27 / 33) * 100 = 82%` (LSP coverage)
- `added: 15, removed: 3, net: +12` (test delta)
- `base: 145, head: 178, delta: +33` (mutation score change)

### Unverifiable Calculations

When inputs or formula unclear:
- "Improved by 15%" without showing base/head values
- Aggregates without components
- Weighted averages without weights stated
- Percentiles without distribution data

## Example Input

```
<pr_metadata>
PR Number: 259
Title: Name span for LSP navigation

```

## Trust Model

### Can Be Verified (High Confidence)

- Exact match between claimed test count and cargo test output
- Line counts from git diff --stat
- Commit SHAs from git log
- CI timing from linked run logs
- Calculation arithmetic (when inputs shown)

### Can Be Inferred (Medium Confidence)

- Whether metric is measurable or qualitative
- Whether omission is intentional or oversight
- Whether comparison baseline is appropriate
- Whether calculation method is sound

### Cannot Be Verified

- Quality of measurement tools themselves
- Whether receipts are edited or complete
- Historical data not provided in inputs
- Future claims ("will improve X")
- Subjective assessments ("comprehensive coverage")

### Red Flags to Note

- Metrics without any provenance statement
- Percentages without showing numerator/denominator
- Performance claims without benchmark receipts
- Deltas without base/head identification
- "Estimated" without estimation method
- Qualitative assessments presented as measurements
- Receipts that contradict claims

## Integration Notes

Measurement Auditor uses:
- **All analyzer outputs**: Validates metrics claimed in synthesized dossier
- **Verification Auditor output**: Cross-checks test count claims
- **Policy Auditor output**: Cross-checks metrics drift findings
- **Tool receipts**: Primary evidence for verification

Measurement Auditor feeds into:
- **Dossier publishing decision**: Block on P1 measurement integrity issues
- **Process improvements**: Identify gaps in receipt collection
- **Lessons learned**: Document provenance best practices

Run Measurement Auditor as final quality gate before dossier publication.
