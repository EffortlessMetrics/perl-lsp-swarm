## Project Stats

- **Perl files**: 13 (.pm / .pl / .t)
- **Fixture source**: test_corpus/real_projects/mojolicious_skeleton/

## Outliers

- **cold_start_to_hover** p95=978ms exceeds 500ms threshold

This is expected for the initial cold-start measurement on the skeleton fixture: the server spawns
fresh for each of 10 samples, measuring spawn + initialize + first hover end-to-end. The p50 (463ms)
is within the expected range for a 13-file project on a debug-build test binary. A release-binary
cold-start would be significantly lower (see Reproducibility Notes below).

The p50=0ms for completion, definition, and workspace-symbol reflects the warmed-server measurement
path where the server is already initialized; these are the latencies that matter to real users during
an editing session.

## Reproducibility Notes

```bash
# Reproduce this measurement
just real-workspace-baseline mojolicious windows
```

- Binary: test harness uses debug build via `cargo test` (not `--release`)
- To measure release cold-start: `cargo build -p perl-lsp-rs --release` then set `PERL_LSP_BIN`
- Test invoked via: `cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs --test real_project_latency real_project_latency_mojolicious -- --include-ignored --nocapture`
- Samples per metric: 10 (p50/p95/p99)
- Fixture path: `test_corpus/real_projects/mojolicious_skeleton/`
- Raw JSON: `.ci/metrics/real_project_latency.json`

## Notes

First baseline run for mojolicious on windows. Establishes measurement anchor for v0.13.0 release gate.
Note: measured on Windows 11 Pro (Git Bash, MSVC toolchain). Linux measurements may differ; a CI-runner
linux baseline can be obtained by running `just real-workspace-baseline mojolicious linux` on a Linux host.

The 13-file mojolicious skeleton covers the key module structure (Mojolicious.pm, Controller, Routes,
Plugins, etc.) without including the full 200+ file CPAN distribution. This is a representative
skeleton measuring realistic LSP initialization and response latency for a medium-complexity Perl
web framework project.
