# Test Evidence Lanes

Defines the **evidence-lane shapes** that perl-lsp's CI organises tests
into: which kinds of tests run on which trigger, with what bound, and
why. The point is to make the cost / signal trade-off explicit so a
contributor can predict which lane fires for their change without
reading every workflow YAML.

This doc pairs with:

- [`ci-lane-map.md`](ci-lane-map.md) — the per-workflow inventory.
- [`../../policy/ci-lanes.toml`](../../policy/ci-lanes.toml) — the
  machine-readable lane policy.
- [`../../policy/ci-risk-packs.toml`](../../policy/ci-risk-packs.toml)
  — path-pattern → label/lane auto-routing.
- [`lem-budgeting.md`](lem-budgeting.md) — cost model.
- [`ripr.md`](ripr.md) — the static oracle-gap detector that sits
  between coverage and runtime mutation testing.

## Doctrine

Test evidence is a spend-vs-signal trade. Different test families
warrant different cadences:

| Test family | Default cadence | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Unit + workspace lib tests | every PR | Cheapest signal per minute. Catch most regressions. |
| Bounded smoke (acceptance-flavoured but capped) | every PR | Constant-cost-per-PR signal that the user-flow surface still works end-to-end. Specifically *not* a full sweep. |
| Broad acceptance / property / fuzz / BDD matrix | label-gated **or** nightly cron | Real evidence but expensive; only fire when a reviewer explicitly asks (`bdd`, `property-tests`, `fuzz`, `full-ci`) or on the scheduled cron. |
| Mutation testing | targeted PR (`mutation` label) **or** nightly cron **or** release readiness | High-cost runtime evidence; never default-PR. |
| `ripr` (static oracle-gap) | every Rust-diff PR | Cheap static substitute that surfaces "this changed line is not exercised by any test that could discriminate behavior." New severe gaps block; existing debt burns down under the dated `ripr-total-burndown` exception in `policy/quality-gate-exceptions.toml`. |
| Coverage | every PR, nightly schedule, workflow_dispatch | Codecov patch status is the merge gate for changed-line coverage; `coverage-baseline.json` and `quality-gate --mode enforce-patch-coverage --codecov codecov.yml` prove the local receipt and live Codecov patch policy rail, and block below-target patch values when a patch percentage is present; project coverage remains burn-down telemetry under the dated `project-coverage-burndown` exception until promoted, and final `quality-gate --mode enforce` requires the Codecov project policy to become blocking `95%` / `0.25%`. |

Both quality-gate summaries include PR-body proof guidance so agents can paste
the objective, claim boundary, non-goals, RIPR effect, coverage effect, local
proof commands, cleanup status, and remaining gaps into the PR before review.

The doctrine, from [`ripr.md`](ripr.md):

> `ripr` shifts mutation signal left — static, per-PR, and cheaper than
> runtime mutation testing, which remains the backstop for what static analysis
> cannot predict. See [`docs/ci/ripr.md`](ripr.md) for the canonical framing.

## Lane shapes

### 1. PR-fast required

Runs on every PR. Blocks merge. Constant per-PR cost.

Includes (this set evolves; consult `ci-lane-map.md` for the current
inventory):

- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- `cargo clippy --workspace --lib --no-deps -- -D warnings`
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --no-deps -- -D warnings -A missing_docs`
- Workspace unit + lib tests for at least `perl-lsp-rs --lib`.
- The bounded UX scenario smoke (e.g. `ux_scenario_14_inc_conformance`).
- `cargo xtask check-lint-policy` and any other `cargo xtask check-*`
  ledger gates that have shipped at the time of the PR (the
  per-checker set grows as ledger PRs land; see
  [`../development/RUST_1_95_PROACTIVE_GUARDS.md`](../development/RUST_1_95_PROACTIVE_GUARDS.md)
  for the planned guards rail).
- `cargo deny check` (if wired into the canonical CI workflow).
- `ripr` new-gap gate.
- Codecov patch coverage gate (`95%`, `0%` threshold).
- `policy/quality-gate-exceptions.toml` documents the temporary total-RIPR and
  project-coverage burn-down exceptions; those entries do not waive the final
  `quality-gate --mode enforce` target. The transition gates require this
  ledger to be present and valid while burn-down debt exists. Final enforce also
  rejects an informational Codecov project policy, so the project status must be
  promoted before the exception ledger is removed. Exception dates are
  machine-checked as `YYYY-MM-DD` with `updated <= review_after <= expires`.

The bound matters as much as the inclusion: PR-fast lanes have a
**capped** cost. A 30-minute property sweep does not belong here; a
30-second bounded smoke does.

### 2. PR-targeted (label-gated)

Runs only when a reviewer applies the routing label. The matching
risk-pack in [`../../policy/ci-risk-packs.toml`](../../policy/ci-risk-packs.toml)
may auto-apply the label based on changed paths (e.g. `parsers-serde`
risk-pack auto-applies `fuzz` when a fuzz target or `*_parse.rs` file
changes).

| Label | Lane it activates |
|---|---|
| `bdd` | broader BDD scenarios in `bdd-testing.yml` (full matrix). |
| `property-tests` | broad property sweep in `property-testing.yml` (high case-count). |
| `fuzz` | quick-fuzz across all parser surfaces in `fuzzing.yml`. |
| `mutation` | targeted mutation testing in `mutation-testing.yml` (scoped to touched risk-pack). |
| `coverage` | Legacy label alias; the Codecov patch gate now runs on every PR. |
| `security-audit` | standalone `cargo-deny` in `ci-security.yml` (also fires on push-main + weekly cron). |
| `full-ci` | "spend authorization": activates every label-gated lane on a single PR. Reviewer signs off on the cost. |

### 3. Nightly cron

Runs on schedule regardless of PRs. Full sweeps, expensive evidence,
canary lanes.

- Full property-test sweep (256+ cases per crate).
- Full fuzz matrix at extended budget.
- Full mutation sweep across trust surfaces.
- Coverage trend canary (`ci-nightly.yml`).
- `ci-nightly.yml` for any other long-running canary.

The point of nightly: surface regressions that the bounded PR-fast
smoke misses, without billing every PR for the full sweep.

### 4. Release-only (tag-triggered)

Runs only when a `v*` tag is pushed or `release.yml` is dispatched.

- Multi-platform release builds (Linux / macOS x86_64 + arm64 / Windows).
- `cargo package --locked` proof.
- `cargo publish --dry-run` on the foundation crate (the rest of the
  publish chain dry-runs interleaved with the actual publish, since
  each non-foundation crate needs the prior crate on crates.io before
  its dry-run resolves).
- Install-smoke against the published artifact.
- Crates.io publish in dependency order (owner-gated).

See [`../release/RUNBOOK.md`](../release/RUNBOOK.md) for the
end-to-end release execution flow.

### 5. Advisory

Lanes that emit signal but **never block merge**. A reviewer reads
their findings and treats them as input to judgement. This category does not
include the diff-scoped RIPR new-gap gate or Codecov patch gate; both are
frontdoor blockers in the coverage / RIPR proof lane.

- Repo-wide RIPR+ total-debt burn-down reports, until the zero gate is
  promoted. Diff-scoped new RIPR+ gaps are blocking now.
- Bot review lanes: `droid-review`, `tokmd`, `CodeRabbit` if active.
- `pr-plan` LEM forecast.
- `methodology-gate` (currently advisory pending its own ratchet).

The reviewer's job is to weight advisory output against the change's
risk surface and the matching risk-pack. A `ripr` finding on a
parser-touching PR is more load-bearing than the same finding on a
docs-only PR.

## Risk-pack auto-routing

Risk packs in [`../../policy/ci-risk-packs.toml`](../../policy/ci-risk-packs.toml)
map changed-path patterns to labels and lanes. Applying a label is a
human reviewer's job; the *suggestion* of which label to apply comes
from the matching risk pack(s).

Example: a PR touching `crates/perl-parser-pest/` matches the
hypothetical `parsers-serde` risk-pack, which surfaces `fuzz` as the
recommended label. The reviewer can:

- Apply `fuzz` → activates the quick-fuzz lane.
- Apply `full-ci` → activates every recommended lane plus the broad ones.
- Apply nothing → the PR runs only PR-fast required lanes.

The risk-pack model is **advisory** at the PR level. The
[`RUST_1_95_PROACTIVE_GUARDS.md`](../development/RUST_1_95_PROACTIVE_GUARDS.md)
rail row PG-2 introduces a checker that verifies risk-pack references
resolve to real lanes and real labels (currently unchecked).

## Skipped-by-policy receipts

When a lane skips for a particular PR, the lane must say **why** via
the GitHub Actions step summary or the lane's emitted receipt JSON.
Categories:

| Category | When |
|---|---|
| `docs-only` | PR matches the docs-only risk pack and no other. |
| `no-matching-risk-pack` | The lane is opt-in via risk pack; no risk pack on this PR selects it. |
| `label-absent` | Lane is opt-in via label; the label is not present. |
| `nightly-only` | Lane runs only on cron. |
| `release-only` | Lane runs only on tag push. |
| `ripr-waived` | A `ripr-waive` label suppressed advisory output for this PR (when wired). |
| `duplicate` | The lane's intent is already produced by another lane on this PR (e.g. standalone `cargo-deny` when `ci.yml` already ran it). |

The PG-5 row in
[`RUST_1_95_PROACTIVE_GUARDS.md`](../development/RUST_1_95_PROACTIVE_GUARDS.md)
adds a CI Actuals emitter that records skip categories in a
machine-readable receipt.

## Cost framing

LEM (Linux Equivalent Minutes) is the unit; see
[`lem-budgeting.md`](lem-budgeting.md) for the model. The PR plan
([`pr-plan.yml`](../../.github/workflows/pr-plan.yml) +
[`../../policy/ci-budget.toml`](../../policy/ci-budget.toml)) forecasts
the spend for each lane the PR would activate.

Tiers:

- `preferred_default_lem` — the spend a docs-only or fixture-only PR
  expects.
- `default_limit_lem` — soft ceiling for a normal PR; the plan warns
  past this without `ci-budget-ack`.
- `elevated_limit_lem` — ceiling for label-elevated PRs; requires
  `ci-budget-override`.
- `hard_limit_lem` — emergency ceiling; requires `full-ci` (which
  implies override).

These are advisory in the current rollout. Hard enforcement is the
C-LL row in
[`../development/RUST_1_95_ROLLOUT.md`](../development/RUST_1_95_ROLLOUT.md)
(learned LEM, actuals-backed calibration).
