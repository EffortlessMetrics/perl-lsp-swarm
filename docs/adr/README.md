# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for significant design decisions in the Perl LSP project.

## Source-of-Truth Layer

ADRs describe durable decisions: the architecture, policy, or operating model
that the repo should continue to follow after the current PR queue has moved
on.

| Layer | Owns | Must not do |
|---|---|---|
| ADR | Durable decision, context, considered options, consequences, follow-up obligations | Test queue, raw worklist, point-in-time metric claims, PR sequencing |

Use ADRs for decisions that change how maintainers and agents interpret the
repo. For lane execution, link ADRs to proposals, specs, plans, and current
status surfaces instead of copying generated status content.

Current generated and human-owned status sources include:

- [parser accuracy next](../project/status/parser_accuracy_next.md)
- [parser status](../project/status/parser.md)
- [provider cutover](../project/status/provider_cutover.md)
- [semantic scorecard](../project/status/semantic_scorecard.md)
- [semantic shadow compare](../project/status/semantic_shadow_compare.md)
- [semantic capability dashboard](../project/status/semantic_capability_dashboard.md)
- [UX capability dashboard](../project/status/ux_capability_dashboard.md)

## About ADRs

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. Each ADR includes:

- **Context**: The situation that led to the decision
- **Decision**: The architectural choice made
- **Consequences**: The results of the decision, both positive and negative

## ADR Process

1. **Identify Decision**: When facing a significant architectural choice
2. **Document Options**: Record all considered alternatives with pros/cons
3. **Make Decision**: Choose the best option based on decision drivers
4. **Record ADR**: Document the decision with full context
5. **Update Index**: Add the new ADR to this index
6. **Link Documentation**: Cross-reference with relevant implementation docs

## Status Definitions

- **Proposed**: Under consideration
- **Accepted**: Decision made and implemented
- **Deprecated**: No longer current but kept for historical context
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer decision
