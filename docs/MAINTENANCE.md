|-------|----------|--------|
| Announcement | 1 release cycle | Document deprecation in release notes |
| Warning Period | 2 minor versions | Emit deprecation warnings |
| Support Period | 1 year from deprecation | Continue to support deprecated feature |
| Removal | Next major version | Remove deprecated feature |

**Deprecation Process**:
1. Announce deprecation in release notes
2. Add deprecation warnings to code
3. Document migration path
4. Track usage metrics
5. Remove in next major version

**Example Deprecation Timeline**:
- v1.2.0: Announce deprecation of `legacy_parser` feature
- v1.2.0-1.4.0: Emit deprecation warnings
- v2.0.0: Remove `legacy_parser` feature

## Runbooks

### Common Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: CI Failure on Main Branch

**Symptoms**:
- CI workflow failing on main branch
- No obvious cause in recent commits

**Steps**:
1. Check recent commits for breaking changes
2. Review CI logs for specific error
3. Run CI locally to reproduce: `nix develop -c just ci-gate`
4. Identify root cause
5. Create fix branch
6. Test fix locally
7. Open PR with fix
8. Merge fix after review
9. Verify CI passes on main

**Prevention**:
- Ensure all PRs pass CI before merge
- Run full CI on merge to main
- Monitor CI health regularly

#### Scenario 2: Security Vulnerability Reported

**Symptoms**:
- Security report received via email or GitHub
- Potential vulnerability in code or dependencies

**Steps**:
1. Acknowledge report within 24 hours
2. Assign severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
3. Create private branch for fix
4. Develop fix with security lead
5. Test fix thoroughly
6. Coordinate disclosure timeline with reporter
7. Release patch and advisory
8. Update documentation

**Prevention**:
- Regular security audits
- Automated security scanning
- Security-aware code review

#### Scenario 3: Performance Regression Detected

**Symptoms**:
- Benchmarks show >20% degradation
- Users report slow performance

**Steps**:
1. Identify specific operation affected
2. Run benchmarks with detailed profiling
3. Identify root cause (commit, change)
4. Create fix branch
5. Develop and test fix
6. Verify benchmarks return to baseline
7. Merge fix
8. Include in next patch release

**Prevention**:
- Benchmark on every PR
- Performance regression detection in CI
- Regular performance audits

#### Scenario 4: Release Rollback Required

**Symptoms**:
- Critical issue discovered after release
- Users affected by breaking change

**Steps**:
1. Assess severity and impact
2. Determine if rollback is necessary
3. Create rollback branch from previous release
4. Tag new release (e.g., 0.9.2-rollback)
5. Publish rollback release
6. Communicate with users
7. Fix underlying issue
8. Release corrected version

**Prevention**:
- Thorough testing before release
- Beta testing for major releases
- Gradual rollout for critical changes

#### Scenario 5: Dependency Update Breaks Build

**Symptoms**:
- Dependabot PR fails CI
- Manual dependency update breaks build

**Steps**:
1. Review CI logs for specific error
2. Check dependency changelog for breaking changes
3. Identify affected code
4. Update code to work with new dependency
5. Test thoroughly
6. If unable to fix, pin to previous version temporarily
7. Document issue and create follow-up

**Prevention**:
- Review dependency changelogs before updating
- Test major version updates thoroughly
- Keep dependencies reasonably up to date

- Identify root cause
- Assess impact and scope
- Determine mitigation strategy

**4. Mitigation** (2-4 hours)
- Implement temporary fix if needed
- Rollback if necessary
- Communicate with users
- Monitor for resolution

**5. Resolution** (4-24 hours)
- Implement permanent fix
- Test thoroughly
- Deploy fix
- Verify resolution

**6. Post-Incident** (24-48 hours)
- Conduct post-incident review
- Document lessons learned
- Update procedures as needed
- Communicate findings

### Emergency Release Process

**When to Use Emergency Release**:
- CRITICAL security vulnerability
- Complete outage affecting all users
- Data loss or corruption issue

**Emergency Release Steps**:
1. Create emergency branch from main
2. Develop and test fix
3. Bump version to next patch
4. Create release tag
5. Trigger release orchestration
6. Monitor release
7. Communicate with users

**Emergency Release Timeline**:
- **Target**: 2-4 hours from fix to release
- **Maximum**: 24 hours for CRITICAL issues

### Communication During Emergencies

**Internal Communication**:
- Immediate notification to all maintainers
- Incident channel for real-time updates
- Regular status updates (every 30 minutes during active incident)

**External Communication**:
- Initial notification within 1 hour (SEV-0/SEV-1)
- Regular updates every 2-4 hours
- Resolution notification when fixed
- Post-incident summary within 48 hours

**Communication Channels**:
- GitHub Issues (public)
- GitHub Discussions (public)
- Discord/Slack (community)
- Email (security reports)

### Backup and Recovery

**Data Backups**:
- Git repository: Hosted on GitHub (automatic backups)
- Issue tracking: Hosted on GitHub (automatic backups)
- Documentation: Version controlled in Git
- Benchmarks: Version controlled in Git

**Recovery Procedures**:
1. Restore from GitHub if needed
2. Verify repository integrity
3. Continue operations from last known good state

**Disaster Recovery**:
- GitHub outage: Continue development locally, push when available
- Maintainer unavailable: Other maintainers step in
- Multiple maintainers unavailable: Pause non-critical work
