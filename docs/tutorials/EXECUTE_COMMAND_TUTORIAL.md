# ExecuteCommand Tutorial (*Diataxis: Tutorial* - Learning-oriented executeCommand guide)

*Get started with the new executeCommand functionality in Perl LSP server. This tutorial walks you through using perl.runCritic and other commands to enhance your Perl development workflow.*

## Overview

The `workspace/executeCommand` LSP method (Issue #145) adds powerful command execution capabilities to the Perl LSP server. This tutorial teaches you how to use these commands effectively in your development environment.

### What You'll Learn

- How to set up and use `perl.runCritic` for code quality analysis
- Understanding the native critic path and explicit legacy compatibility
- Integrating executeCommand with your LSP editor workflow
- Performance optimization and troubleshooting techniques
- Testing and validating executeCommand functionality

### Prerequisites

- Perl LSP server v0.8.8+ installed and running
- Basic understanding of LSP protocol and your LSP-compatible editor
- Perl development environment with test files

### Time to Complete

Approximately 30-45 minutes for complete walkthrough with all examples.

## Getting Started with perl.runCritic

### Step 1: Verify LSP Server Capabilities

First, ensure your LSP server advertises executeCommand capabilities:

```bash
# Test that executeCommand is supported
cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs --test lsp_behavioral_tests -- test_execute_command_capabilities

# Verify perl.runCritic is in supported commands list
cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs test_supported_commands_includes_run_critic --lib
```

**Expected Output**: Tests should pass, confirming executeCommand support.

### Step 2: Create a Sample Perl File

Create a test file to analyze:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
# File: /tmp/sample_analysis.pl

my $name = "Alice";
my $age = 30;

print "Hello $name, you are $age years old\n";

sub greet {
    my ($person) = @_;
    print "Greetings, $person!\n";
}

greet($name);
```

**Learning Goal**: This file intentionally lacks `use strict` and `use warnings` pragmas that perl.runCritic will detect.

### Step 3: Test Native Critic

Run the native critic tests (always available):

```bash
# Test native critic rule behavior
cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs-core native_critic --profile agent --locked -- --nocapture

# Test native critic diagnostics through the LSP runtime
cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs native_critic_engine --profile agent --locked --lib -- --nocapture
```

**What Happens**:
- Native critic detects missing `use strict` and `use warnings`
- Analysis avoids external `perlcritic` process startup
- Returns structured findings with rule IDs, ranges, severities, and explanations

**Example Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "violations": [
    {
      "policy": "RequireUseStrict",
      "description": "Missing 'use strict' pragma",
      "explanation": "Always use 'use strict' to catch common errors",
      "severity": 3,
      "line": 1,
      "column": 1,
      "file": "/tmp/sample_analysis.pl"
    },
    {
      "policy": "RequireUseWarnings",
      "description": "Missing 'use warnings' pragma",
      "explanation": "Always use 'use warnings' to catch potential issues",
      "severity": 3,
      "line": 1,
      "column": 1,
      "file": "/tmp/sample_analysis.pl"
    }
  ],
  "violationCount": 2,
  "engine": "native"
}
```

### Step 4: Understanding Native Critic and Legacy Compatibility

The normal editor diagnostic path uses the native critic engine by default.
`perl.runCritic` remains a compatibility-oriented execute command for projects
that still compare against legacy Perl::Critic output.

1. **Default Path**: Native critic recommended profile
2. **Compatibility Path**: External `perlcritic` when explicitly selected
3. **Migration Support**: Compatibility receipts map legacy policies to native
   rules

**Test the Native Runtime Path**:
```bash
cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs native_critic_engine --profile agent --locked --lib -- --nocapture
cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs diagnostics --profile agent --locked --lib -- --nocapture
```

**Learning Goal**: Understand that native diagnostics do not depend on external
tool availability, while the legacy command path remains available for
compatibility testing.

### Step 5: Install External Perlcritic (Optional Compatibility)

Install external perlcritic only when you need exact legacy policy behavior:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install perlcritic

# macOS
brew install perl-critic

# Or via CPAN
cpan Perl::Critic

# Verify installation
which perlcritic
perlcritic --version
```

**When to use External Perlcritic**:
- a project requires exact Perl::Critic policy output
- a `.perlcriticrc` policy is classified as external-only
- a team is comparing native findings with a legacy baseline during migration

### Step 6: LSP Protocol Integration

#### Manual LSP Request (Advanced)

You can manually test the LSP protocol integration:

```json
// Send this via your LSP client or testing tool
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "workspace/executeCommand",
  "params": {
    "command": "perl.runCritic",
    "arguments": ["/tmp/sample_analysis.pl"]
  }
}
```

#### Editor Integration Examples

**VSCode**: Commands appear in Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`):
- "Perl: Run Critic Analysis"
- "Perl: Run Tests"
- "Perl: Run File"

**Neovim with nvim-lspconfig**:
```lua
-- Add to your Neovim configuration
vim.api.nvim_create_user_command('PerlCritic', function()
  local file_path = vim.fn.expand('%:p')
  vim.lsp.buf.execute_command({
    command = 'perl.runCritic',
    arguments = { file_path }
  })
end, {})
```

**Emacs with lsp-mode**:
```elisp
;; Add to your Emacs configuration
(defun perl-run-critic ()
  "Run perl.runCritic on current file"
  (interactive)
  (lsp-execute-command "perl.runCritic" (list (buffer-file-name))))
```

## Working with Analysis Results

### Step 7: Understanding Violations

Each violation includes key information:

- **Policy**: The rule that was violated (e.g., "RequireUseStrict")
- **Severity**: Numerical severity (1-5, with 5 being most severe)
- **Description**: Human-readable description of the issue
- **Explanation**: Detailed explanation and fix guidance
- **Location**: Precise line and column numbers
- **File**: Full file path for multi-file analysis

### Step 8: Fix Common Issues

Based on the sample file, make these improvements:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;      # Added: addresses RequireUseStrict
use warnings;    # Added: addresses RequireUseWarnings

my $name = "Alice";
my $age = 30;

print "Hello $name, you are $age years old\n";

sub greet {
    my ($person) = @_;
    print "Greetings, $person!\n";
    return;      # Added: good practice for explicit return
}

greet($name);
```

### Step 9: Re-analyze the Fixed File

Save your fixes and re-run analysis:

```bash
# Test with a clean file (should have fewer violations)
echo '#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $name = "Alice";
print "Hello $name!\n";' > /tmp/clean_sample.pl

# Native critic should show fewer findings
cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs native_critic_engine --profile agent --locked --lib -- --nocapture
```

## Performance and Reliability

### Step 10: Performance Characteristics

Understanding timing expectations:

| File Size | Native Critic | External Perlcritic Compatibility | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------------------|-------|
| <1KB      | Fast local analysis | Adds process startup | Typical small scripts |
| 1-10KB    | Parser/runtime bound | Process + output parsing | Standard modules |
| 10-100KB  | Profile dependent | Process + policy dependent | Large applications |

### Step 11: Testing Performance

```bash
# Validate performance targets
cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs --test lsp_performance_tests -- test_execute_command_latency

# Test with adaptive threading (recommended for CI)
RUST_TEST_THREADS=2 cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs --test lsp_execute_command_tests -- --test-threads=2
```

### Step 12: Error Handling

Test error scenarios:

```bash
# Test with non-existent file
cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs test_execute_command_run_critic_missing_file --lib

# Test parameter validation
cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs test_parameter_validation_missing_file_path --lib
```

**Learning Goal**: The system handles errors gracefully with informative messages.

## Integration with Code Actions

### Step 13: Combining with Code Actions

The executeCommand workflow integrates with textDocument/codeAction for complete development support:

```bash
# Test integrated workflow
cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs --test lsp_comprehensive_e2e_test -- test_execute_command_and_code_actions

# Test specific code action integration
cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs --test lsp_code_actions_tests -- test_modernize_code_actions
```

**Workflow**:
1. **Execute** perl.runCritic to find issues
2. **Analyze** results in diagnostics
3. **Apply** code actions to fix issues
4. **Re-execute** to verify fixes

## Advanced Usage

### Step 14: Other executeCommand Operations

Explore the full command set:

```bash
# perl.runTests - Execute Perl test files
cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs --test lsp_behavioral_tests -- test_execute_command_run_tests

# perl.runFile - Execute single Perl file
cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs --test lsp_behavioral_tests -- test_execute_command_run_file

# perl.debugTests - Debug preparation
cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs --test lsp_behavioral_tests -- test_execute_command_debug_tests
```

### Step 15: Quality Assurance Validation

Validate your setup meets all acceptance criteria:

```bash
# executeCommand LSP method implementation
cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs --test lsp_execute_command_tests -- test_execute_command_capabilities

# perl.runCritic native critic integration
cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs native_critic_engine --profile agent --locked --lib -- --nocapture

# Advanced refactoring operations
cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs --test lsp_code_actions_tests -- test_organize_imports
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: executeCommand Not Available

**Problem**: Editor doesn't show perl.runCritic command
**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify server capabilities
cargo test -p perl-lsp-rs --test lsp_behavioral_tests -- test_execute_command_capabilities

# Check LSP server logs for capability advertisement
perllsp --stdio --log
```

### Issue: Analysis Takes Too Long

**Problem**: perl.runCritic timeout or slow response
**Solutions**:
- Check file size: `wc -l your_file.pl`
- Keep the default native engine for editor diagnostics
- Test external tool directly only when explicit legacy compatibility is selected: `time perlcritic your_file.pl`

### Issue: No Violations Found

**Problem**: Clean code shows no policy violations
**Expected**: This is correct behavior! Clean code should have minimal violations.
**Verify**: Test with a file missing `use strict` to confirm detection works.

## Next Steps

### Recommended Learning Path

1. **Explore Code Actions**: Learn about RefactorExtract and SourceOrganizeImports
2. **Cross-file Analysis**: Try executeCommand with multi-file projects
3. **Custom Workflows**: Integrate with your build and CI systems
