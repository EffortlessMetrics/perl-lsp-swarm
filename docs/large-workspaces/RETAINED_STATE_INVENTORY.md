# Retained-State Inventory

This inventory tracks long-lived state that can retain per-document or
per-workspace memory across an LSP session. Every long-lived map, cache, task
queue, or subprocess/session holder must document:

- owner
- key type
- byte-risk
- eviction event
- pressure counter or retained-process signal
- regression test or receipt

The goal is not to make RSS return to the exact startup value. Allocators and
`HashMap` capacity can retain arenas after work completes. The goal is to make
retained state bounded, explainable, and covered by counters or receipts.

## Lifecycle Semantics

Close and delete are different lifecycle events.

| Lifecycle | Required behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Close-only: `didOpen -> didClose` | Evict editor/session state for the open buffer. Workspace-backed indexes may retain file symbols because the source file still exists. |
| Close and delete: `didOpen -> didClose -> watched-file DELETED` | Evict editor/session state and remove workspace-index state for that file. No index structure should retain the deleted URI after pending work drains. |
| Workspace-folder removal | Evict open documents and workspace-index state under the removed roots only. Unrelated roots must remain intact. |

Use `evict_open_document_session_state(uri)` for close-only state,
`evict_deleted_file_state(uri)` for deleted files, and
`evict_workspace_folder_state(folder_uri)` for folder-scoped cleanup.

Background tasks must not be allowed to repopulate stale state after close,
delete, or folder removal. Indexing tasks need generation or version validation
before committing derived state.

## Current Inventory

The live `LspServer` does not retain an AST-only parse cache. `didOpen`,
`didChange`, and the asynchronous parse-worker route run the full parser for
each current document parse and publish its complete outcome, including
recovery diagnostics. A complete parse-artifact store is future work.

| Owner | State | Key type | Byte-risk | Bounds and cleanup | Pressure counter or signal | Regression test or receipt |
|-------|-------|----------|-----------|--------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| `LspServer` | Open documents in `documents` | Normalized URI `String` | Raw source text and document metadata | `didClose` uses `evict_open_document_session_state`; delete and folder removal route through stronger helpers | `MemoryStateSnapshot.documents`; `MemoryStateSnapshot.open_text_bytes` | `test_did_close_zeroes_memory_state_snapshot`; folder-removal tests in `workspace.rs` |

| `WorkspaceIndex` | Files, symbols, references, semantic shards, import/export facts | Normalized URI plus symbol/reference keys | Workspace-wide derived state, potentially proportional to workspace size | Delete and reindex use `remove_file`/`clear_file`; close-only should not remove file-backed symbols | `WorkspaceIndex::memory_snapshot`; memory plateau receipt fields | `memory_leak_regression.rs`; close/delete lifecycle tests; memory plateau receipts |

## Memory Budgets

| Area | Budget |
|------|--------|
| LSP doc churn PR smoke | 75 files, 5 changes, loose plateau, artifacts retained |
| Nightly doc churn | 500 files, 10 changes, strict plateau |
| Nightly workspace-symbol churn | 300 files, 10 changes, strict plateau |
| POD cache | Soft cap 1024 entries, prune target 512 |
| Semantic analyzer cache | 50 entries before clear |
| Runtime AST cache | 100 entries, 300 second TTL, explicit remove on close/delete |
| Workspace index caches | Use configured workspace resource limits; delete/reindex must not duplicate secondary indexes |

## Regression Surfaces

Memory coverage should stay split by subsystem. A single large memory test is
hard to interpret; focused scenarios make the owner obvious.

| Scenario | Purpose | Current status |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| `lsp_doc_churn_delete` | Baseline open/change/close/delete process RSS plateau | PR smoke and nightly receipts |
| `lsp_workspace_symbol_churn_delete` | Index/query pressure during document churn | Nightly receipts |
| `workspace_index_reindex_same_files` | Secondary-index duplication and remove/reindex cycles | Unit regression coverage |
| `diagnostics_pull_push_churn` | Pull diagnostics, result ids, critic analyzer cache | Unit retained-state coverage |
| `hover_pod_many_modules` | POD cache cap and path eviction | Unit retained-state coverage |
| `completion_stream_cancel_storm` | Stream-session cancellation and removal | Unit regression coverage |
| `file_watcher_bulk_create_change_delete` | Watcher debouncer and delete lifecycle | Unit retained-state coverage |
| `workspace_folder_add_remove_multi_root` | Folder-scoped cleanup without cross-root eviction | Unit coverage |
| `dap_bridge_start_stop_loop` | Debug process/session lifecycle | Unit retained-process coverage |
| `formatting_perltidy_loop` | Subprocess and output-buffer retention | Unit retained-state coverage |

## Review Checklist

If a PR adds or changes a long-lived map, cache, task queue, or session holder,
the review must answer:

- What owns it?
- What bounds it?
- What removes entries?
- Is key normalization handled?
- Does close differ from delete?
- Can delayed background work repopulate stale state?
- Is there a regression test?
- Is there a pressure counter, retained-process signal, or receipt?

## Investigation Playbook

When memory growth moves again:

1. Identify the growing process: parent LSP, child process, native/FFI, or
   subprocess runtime.
2. Identify the lifecycle: close-only, close/delete, reindex, query churn,
   cancellation, folder removal, DAP session, or external tool loop.
3. Capture counters: documents, stream sessions, parse flags, pending tasks,
   cache entries, workspace index stats, subprocess/session counts.
4. Reproduce with the narrowest harness that triggers the growth.
5. Add a failing regression before changing cleanup logic.
6. Patch the owner or eviction boundary.
7. Add or update a receipt so future runs classify the retained surface.

Use the GitHub **Memory Regression** issue template for plateau or retained-state
failures. The issue should name the scenario, commit, workflow run, artifact,
tail growth, median tail slope, lifecycle, nonzero counters, and suspected
owner before implementation begins.
