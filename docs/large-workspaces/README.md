# Large-Workspace Contributor Guides

Practical guides for contributors working with or testing against large
Perl workspaces (5 000–10 000+ files).

| Guide | When to read it |
|-------|----------------|
| [TESTING_GUIDE.md](TESTING_GUIDE.md) | Generating test workspaces, writing large-workspace tests, performance baselines |
| [PROFILING_GUIDE.md](PROFILING_GUIDE.md) | CPU flamegraphs, heap profiling, criterion benchmarks |
| [MEMORY_PATTERNS.md](MEMORY_PATTERNS.md) | How memory scales, cache behavior, common anti-patterns |
| [RETAINED_STATE_INVENTORY.md](RETAINED_STATE_INVENTORY.md) | Long-lived maps, caches, queues, cleanup events, and regression coverage |
| [LSP_CHURN_REPRO.md](LSP_CHURN_REPRO.md) | Reproducing open/change/close RSS churn and checking plateau behavior |
| [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) | Diagnosing slowdowns, stale symbols, index degradation |

Memory plateau or retained-state regressions should be filed with the
**Memory Regression** issue template so the report includes the receipt,
counter, lifecycle, and suspected owner evidence needed for triage.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Generate a 5 000-file synthetic workspace
bash scripts/gen-large-workspace.sh /tmp/big-workspace 5000

# Run the workspace index benchmarks
just bench

# Compare against baseline
just bench-compare

# Check running LSP server health
perllsp --health

# Debug log for troubleshooting
RUST_LOG=perl_lsp=debug,perl_workspace_index=debug perllsp --stdio 2>debug.log
```
